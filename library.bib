@article{Giacco2010,
abstract = {Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the development of diabetes complications, both microvascular and cardiovascular. The metabolic abnormalities of diabetes cause mitochondrial superoxide overproduction in endothelial cells of both large and small vessels, as well as in the myocardium. This increased superoxide production causes the activation of 5 major pathways involved in the pathogenesis of complications: polyol pathway flux, increased formation of AGEs (advanced glycation end products), increased expression of the receptor for AGEs and its activating ligands, activation of protein kinase C isoforms, and overactivity of the hexosamine pathway. It also directly inactivates 2 critical antiatherosclerotic enzymes, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and prostacyclin synthase. Through these pathways, increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause defective angiogenesis in response to ischemia, activate a number of proinflammatory pathways, and cause long-lasting epigenetic changes that drive persistent expression of proinflammatory genes after glycemia is normalized ("hyperglycemic memory"). Atherosclerosis and cardiomyopathy in type 2 diabetes are caused in part by pathway-selective insulin resistance, which increases mitochondrial ROS production from free fatty acids and by inactivation of antiatherosclerosis enzymes by ROS. Overexpression of superoxide dismutase in transgenic diabetic mice prevents diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiomyopathy. The aim of this review is to highlight advances in understanding the role of metabolite-generated ROS in the development of diabetic complications.},

abstract = {We have investigated the mechanical properties of fibroblast cells after adding the myosin inhibitor blebbistatin and the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 by atomic force microscopy (AFM). We have observed a decrease in the elastic modulus from a value of around 20 kPa down to a value around 8 kPa on a time scale of around 30-60 min when applying the myosin inhibitor blebbistatin, whereas the Y-27632 did not show any prominent mechanical effects. From topographic images, we can conclude that, after adding blebbistatin, actin filaments are not visible any more, whereas Y-27632 did not show any prominent effects in cell morphology. This study shows that tension generated by myosin contributes to the cellular stiffness and thus can be observed by measuring the elastic modulus of cells.},

@article{Jeggle2013,
abstract = {Liddle syndrome, an inherited form of hypertension, is caused by gain-of-function mutations in the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC), the principal mediator of Na(+) reabsorption in the kidney. Accordingly, the disease pathology was ascribed to a primary renal mechanism. Whether this is the sole responsible mechanism, however, remains uncertain as dysregulation of ENaC in other tissues may also be involved. Previous work indicates that ENaC in the vascular endothelium is crucial for the regulation of cellular mechanics and thus vascular function. The hormone aldosterone has been shown to concomitantly increase ENaC surface expression and stiffness of the cell cortex in vascular endothelial cells. The latter entails a reduced release of the vasodilator nitric oxide, which eventually leads to an increase in vascular tone and blood pressure. Using atomic force microscopy, we have found a direct correlation between ENaC surface expression and the formation of cortical stiffness in endothelial cells. Stable knockdown of $\alpha$ENaC in endothelial cells evoked a reduced channel surface density and a lower cortical stiffness compared with the mock control. In turn, an increased $\alpha$ENaC expression induced an elevated cortical stiffness. More importantly, using ex vivo preparations from a mouse model for Liddle syndrome, we show that this disorder evokes enhanced ENaC expression and increased cortical stiffness in vascular endothelial cells in situ. We conclude that ENaC in the vascular endothelium determines cellular mechanics and hence might participate in the control of vascular function.},

abstract = {Bioanalytical science is experiencing a period of unprecedented growth. Drivers behind this growth include the need to detect markers central to human and veterinary diagnostics at ever-lower levels and greater speeds. A set of parallel arguments applies to pathogens with respect to bioterrorism prevention and food and water safety. This tutorial review outlines our recent explorations on the use of surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for detection of proteins, viruses, and microorganisms in heterogeneous immunoassays. It will detail the design and fabrication of the assay platform, including the capture substrate and nanoparticle-based labels. The latter, which is the cornerstone of our strategy, relies on the construction of gold nanoparticles modified with both an intrinsically strong Raman scatterer and an antibody. This labelling motif, referred to as extrinsic Raman labels (ERLs), takes advantage of the well-established signal enhancement of scatterers when coated on nanometre-sized gold particles, whereas the antibody imparts antigenic specificity. We will also examine the role of plasmon coupling between the ERLs and capture substrate, and challenges related to particle stability, nonspecific adsorption, and assay speed.},

@article{Sen2005,
abstract = {In probing adhesion and cell mechanics by atomic force microscopy (AFM), the mechanical properties of the membrane have an important if neglected role. Here we theoretically model the contact of an AFM tip with a cell membrane, where direct motivation and data are derived from a prototypical ligand-receptor adhesion experiment. An AFM tip is functionalized with a prototypical ligand, SIRPalpha, and then used to probe its native receptor on red cells, CD47. The interactions prove specific and typical in force, and also show in detachment, a sawtooth-shaped disruption process that can extend over hundreds of nm. The theoretical model here that accounts for both membrane indentation as well as membrane extension in tip retraction incorporates membrane tension and elasticity as well as AFM tip geometry and stochastic disruption. Importantly, indentation depth proves initially proportional to membrane tension and does not follow the standard Hertz model. Computations of detachment confirm nonperiodic disruption with membrane extensions of hundreds of nm set by membrane tension. Membrane mechanical properties thus clearly influence AFM probing of cells, including single molecule adhesion experiments.},

abstract = {Mitochondria can be a source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a target of oxidative damage during oxidative stress. In this connection, the effect of photodynamic treatment (PDT) with Mitotracker Red (MR) as a mitochondria-targeted photosensitizer has been studied in HeLa cells. It is shown that MR produces both singlet oxygen and superoxide anion upon photoactivation and causes photoinactivation of gramicidin channels in a model system (planar lipid bilayer). Mitochondria-targeted antioxidant (MitoQ) inhibits this effect. In living cells, MR-mediated PDT initiates a delayed ("dark") accumulation of ROS, which is accelerated by inhibitors of the respiratory chain (piericidin, rotenone and myxothiazol) and inhibited by MitoQ and diphenyleneiodonium (an inhibitor of flavin enzymes), indicating that flavin of Complex I is involved in the ROS production. PDT causes necrosis that is prevented by MitoQ. Treatment of the cell with hydrogen peroxide causes accumulation of ROS, and the effects of inhibitors and MitoQ are similar to that described for the PDT model. Apoptosis caused by H2O2 is augmented by the inhibitors of respiration and suppressed by MitoQ. It is concluded that the initial segments of the respiratory chain can be an important source of ROS, which are targeted to mitochondria, determining the fate of the cell subjected to oxidative stress.},

abstract = {Cell adhesion is required for essential biological functions such as migration, tissue formation and wound healing, and it is mediated by individual molecules that bind specifically to ligands on other cells or on the extracellular matrix. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been successfully used to measure cell adhesion at both single molecule and whole cell levels. However, the measurement of inherent cell adhesion properties requires a constant cell–probe contact area during indentation, a requirement which is not fulfilled in common pyramidal or spherical AFM tips. We developed a procedure using focused ion beam (FIB) technology by which we modified silicon pyramidalAFM cantilever tips to obtain flat-ended cylindrical tips with a constant and known area of contact. The tips were validated on elastic gels and living cells. Cylindrical tips showed a fairly linear force–indentation behaviour on both gels and cells for indentations >200nm. Cylindrical tips coated with ligands were used to quantify inherent dynamic cell adhesion and elastic properties. Force, work of adhesion and elasticity showed a marked dynamic response. In contrast, the deformation applied to the cells before rupture was fairly constant within the probed dynamic range. Taken together, these results suggest that the dynamic adhesion strength is counterbalanced by the dynamic elastic response to keep a constant cell deformation regardless of the applied pulling rate.

abstract = {There are few findings indicating that nicotinamide may potentially influence intravascular thrombosis. Interestingly, N-methylnicotinamide, one of the metabolites of nicotinamide - could be more potent than its parent compound. In the present study we have investigated the influence of N-methylnicotinamide on arterial thrombosis in normotensive and renovascular hypertensive rats. The contribution of platelets, coagulation and fibrinolytic systems in the mode of N-methylnicotinamide action was also determined. Furthermore, we examined the role of nitric oxide/prostacyclin in the mechanisms of N-methylnicotinamide action. N-methylnicotinamide, but not nicotinamide, administered intravenously into renovascular hypertensive rats developing electrically induced arterial thrombosis caused dose-dependent decrease of thrombus weight, collagen-induced platelet aggregation and plasma antigen/activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1, without changing of occlusion time, routine coagulation parameters and plasma activity of tissue plasminogen activator. Indomethacin - an inhibitor of prostacyclin synthesis, completely abolished the antithrombotic and antiplatelet effect of N-methylnicotinamide, and the plasma level of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) , prostacyclin metabolite, increased simultaneously with the inhibition of thrombus formation. Our study shows that N-methylnicotinamide via production/release of prostacyclin inhibits arterial thrombosis development. The antithrombotic effect of N-methylnicotinamide is accompanied by platelet inhibition and enhanced fibrinolysis, due to the decrease production of plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1.},

abstract = {Endothelial cells (EC) form a unique signal-transducing surface in the vascular system. The abundance of ion channels in the plasma membrane of these nonexcitable cells has raised questions about their functional role. This review presents evidence for the involvement of ion channels in endothelial cell functions controlled by intracellular Ca(2+) signals, such as the production and release of many vasoactive factors, e.g., nitric oxide and PGI(2). In addition, ion channels may be involved in the regulation of the traffic of macromolecules by endocytosis, transcytosis, the biosynthetic-secretory pathway, and exocytosis, e.g., tissue factor pathway inhibitor, von Willebrand factor, and tissue plasminogen activator. Ion channels are also involved in controlling intercellular permeability, EC proliferation, and angiogenesis. These functions are supported or triggered via ion channels, which either provide Ca(2+)-entry pathways or stabilize the driving force for Ca(2+) influx through these pathways. These Ca(2+)-entry pathways comprise agonist-activated nonselective Ca(2+)-permeable cation channels, cyclic nucleotide-activated nonselective cation channels, and store-operated Ca(2+) channels or capacitative Ca(2+) entry. At least some of these channels appear to be expressed by genes of the trp family. The driving force for Ca(2+) entry is mainly controlled by large-conductance Ca(2+)-dependent BK(Ca) channels (slo), inwardly rectifying K(+) channels (Kir2.1), and at least two types of Cl( -) channels, i.e., the Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channel and the housekeeping, volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC). In addition to their essential function in Ca(2+) signaling, VRAC channels are multifunctional, operate as a transport pathway for amino acids and organic osmolytes, and are possibly involved in endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Finally, we have also highlighted the role of ion channels as mechanosensors in EC. Plasmalemmal ion channels may signal rapid changes in hemodynamic forces, such as shear stress and biaxial tensile stress, but also changes in cell shape and cell volume to the cytoskeleton and the intracellular machinery for metabolite traffic and gene expression.},

abstract = {In diabetes, some of the cellular changes are similar to aging. We hypothesized that hyperglycemia accelerates aging-like changes in the endothelial cells (ECs) and tissues leading to structural and functional damage. We investigated glucose-induced aging in 3 types of ECs using senescence associated $\beta$-gal (SA $\beta$-gal) staining and cell morphology. Alterations of sirtuins (SIRTs) and their downstream mediator FOXO and oxidative stress were investigated. Relationship of such alteration with histone acetylase (HAT) p300 was examined. Similar examinations were performed in tissues of diabetic animals. ECs in high glucose (HG) showed evidence of early senescence as demonstrated by increased SA $\beta$-gal positivity and reduced replicative capacities. These alterations were pronounced in microvascular ECs. They developed an irregular and hypertrophic phenotype. Such changes were associated with decreased SIRT (1-7) mRNA expressions. We also found that p300 and SIRT1 regulate each other in such process, as silencing one led to increase of the others' expression. Furthermore, HG caused reduction in FOXO1's DNA binding ability and antioxidant target gene expressions. Chemically induced increased SIRT1 activity and p300 knockdown corrected these abnormalities slowing aging-like changes. Diabetic animals showed increased cellular senescence in renal glomerulus and retinal blood vessels along with reduced SIRT1 mRNA expressions in these tissues. Data from this study demonstrated that hyperglycemia accelerates aging-like process in the vascular ECs and such process is mediated via downregulation of SIRT1, causing reduction of mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme in a p300 and FOXO1 mediated pathway.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glycemic memory of endothelial cells is an effect of long-lasting hyperglycemia and is a cause of various diabetics complications, that arises despite of the treatment targeted towards returning low glucose level in blood system. On the other hand, endothelial dysfunction, which is believed to be a main cause of cardiovascular complications, is exhibited in the changes of mechanical properties of cells. Although formation of the glycemic memory was widely investigated, its impact on the mechanical properties of endothelial cells has not been studied yet.

METHODS: In this study, nanoindentaion with a tip of an atomic force microscope was used to probe the long-term changes (through 26 passages, c.a. 80 days) in mechanical properties of EA.hy926 endothelial cells cultured in hyperglycemic conditions. As a complementary method, alterations in the structure of actin cytoskeleton were visualized by fluorescent staining of F-actin.

RESULTS: We observed a gradual stiffening of the cells up to 20th passage for cells cultured in high glucose (25 mM). Fluorescence imaging has revealed that this behavior resulted from systematic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. In further passages, a drop in stiffness had occurred. The most interesting finding was recorded for cells transferred after 14 passages from high glucose to normal glucose conditions (5mM). After the transfer, the initial drop in stiffness was followed by a return of the cell stiffness to the value previously observed for cells cultured constantly in high glucose

CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that glycemic memory causes irreversible changes in stiffness of endothelial cells. The formation of the observed "stiffness memory" could be important in the context of vascular complications which develop despite the normalization of the glucose level.},

abstract = {The recruitment of T lymphocytes to lymphoid organs or sites of inflammation is a crucial step in adaptive immunity. These processes require endothelial activation and expression of adhesion molecules, including E- and P-selectins, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). However, the complete characterization of the adhesion strength and dynamics between lymphocytes and endothelial cells has been hampered by the lack of sensitive quantitative techniques. Here we report on the application of atomic force microscopy to characterize the interaction between individual pairs of living T lymphocytes (i.e., Jurkat cells) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The detachment of individual cell-cell conjugates was a complex process involving several step-like rupture events and the viscoelastic deformation of cells on the scale of several microns. Adhesion between Jurkat cells and activated endothelial cells increased with compression force and contact time, with the most dramatic changes occurring within the first half second of contact. After 0.25 sec of contact, E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 contributed to 18\%, 39\%, and 41\% of total adhesion strength, respectively, suggesting that ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 contributed more than the selectins in supporting cell attachment.},

abstract = {Keratocytes are fast-moving cells in which adhesion dynamics are tightly coupled to the actin polymerization motor that drives migration, resulting in highly coordinated cell movement. We have found that modifying the adhesive properties of the underlying substrate has a dramatic effect on keratocyte morphology. Cells crawling at intermediate adhesion strengths resembled stereotypical keratocytes, characterized by a broad, fan-shaped lamellipodium, clearly defined leading and trailing edges, and persistent rates of protrusion and retraction. Cells at low adhesion strength were small and round with highly variable protrusion and retraction rates, and cells at high adhesion strength were large and asymmetrical and, strikingly, exhibited traveling waves of protrusion. To elucidate the mechanisms by which adhesion strength determines cell behavior, we examined the organization of adhesions, myosin II, and the actin network in keratocytes migrating on substrates with different adhesion strengths. On the whole, our results are consistent with a quantitative physical model in which keratocyte shape and migratory behavior emerge from the self-organization of actin, adhesions, and myosin, and quantitative changes in either adhesion strength or myosin contraction can switch keratocytes among qualitatively distinct migration regimes.},

The endothelial glycocalyx is a network of membrane-bound proteoglycans and glycoproteins, covering the endothelium luminally. Both endothelium- and plasma-derived soluble molecules integrate into this mesh. Over the past decade, insight has been gained into the role of the glycocalyx in vascular physiology and pathology, including mechanotransduction, hemostasis, signaling, and blood cell-vessel wall interactions. The contribution of the glycocalyx to diabetes, ischemia/reperfusion, and atherosclerosis is also reviewed. Experimental data from the micro- and macrocirculation alludes at a vasculoprotective role for the glycocalyx. Assessing this possible role of the endothelial glycocalyx requires reliable visualization of this delicate layer, which is a great challenge. An overview is given of the various ways in which the endothelial glycocalyx has been visualized up to now, including first data from two-photon microscopic imaging.},

abstract = {Modification of cell surface oligosaccharides by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the biological effect of such modifications on cell adhesion were investigated. Treatment of HL60, a human promyelocyte leukemia cell line, with ROS, generated by a combination of hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase (HX/XO), decreased the sialic acid content on the cell surface, as indicated by a flow cytometric analysis involving sialic acid-specific lectins, and a concomitant increase of free sialic acid was observed in the supernatant. A cell adhesion assay showed that the HX/XO treatment of HL60 cells decreases their capability of binding to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), probably because of an impairment of the interaction involving E-selectin, whereas the decrease in the binding was canceled by the addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. In fact, cell surface sialyl lewis x (sLe x), but not lewis x (Le x), was decreased by HX/XO treatment. Thus, it is more likely that the impaired interaction is based on diminished levels of the selectin ligand. Cleavage of sialic acid by ROS was further verified by the degradation of 4MU-Neu5Ac by HX/XO in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and iron ion. These results indicate that glycosidic linkage of sialic acid is a potential target for superoxide and other related ROS. It is well known that ROS cause cellular damages such as lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, but, as suggested by the findings reported in the literature, ROS may also regulate cell adhesion via the structural alteration of sialylated oligosaccharides on the cell surface.},

Here we perform finite element simulations and semi-analytical modeling of the BFP operation to show that, at low aspiration pressures, there exists a characteristic regime in which the relation between stiffness and aspiration pressure is actually nonlinear. We find that this nonlinear characteristic regime arises from a transition in configuration of a partially aspirated biomembrane force probe under increasing aspiration pressure. We discuss both the conditions for the transition and the characteristics of the nonlinear characteristic regime, as well as its potential applications.},

abstract = {Intermediate filaments (IFs) constitute a major structural element of animal cells. They build two distinct systems, one in the nucleus and one in the cytoplasm. In both cases, their major function is assumed to be that of a mechanical stress absorber and an integrating device for the entire cytoskeleton. In line with this, recent disease mutations in human IF proteins indicate that the nanomechanical properties of cell-type-specific IFs are central to the pathogenesis of diseases as diverse as muscular dystrophy and premature ageing. However, the analysis of these various diseases suggests that IFs also have an important role in cell-type-specific physiological functions.},

abstract = {The viscoelastic properties of cultured endothelial cells exposed to shear stress were measured by the micropipette technique and analyzed using a standard linear viscoelastic model. Cells from porcine aorta were cultured on glass coverslips. A shear stress of 2 Pa was applied using a parallel-plate flow chamber. After flow exposure, the cells were detached from the coverslips and suspended in culture medium. The micropipette experiment was performed on single cells under an inverted microscope. The desired negative pressure was applied stepwise to the tip of the micropipette by opening a solenoid valve. The deformation process of cells in the micropipette was observed through a TV camera and recorded on a videotape. To obtain the viscoelastic parameters, a half-space model of an endothelial cell was used. The cell was assumed to be a homogeneous and incompressible material, and a standard linear viscoelastic model was employed to account for the viscoelastic response. Cells exposed to shear stress for 6 h became spherical in shape after detachment from the substrate. In the case of a 24 h exposure, about half of the detached cells retained an elongated shape upon detachment, with the others taking on a spherical shape. The elastic constants, as determined based on the model, were approximately two times higher for the elongated cells than for control cells from static culture, no-flow conditions, indicating that the elongated cells became stiffer. Enhanced viscous properties also were observed for the elongated cells. These viscoelastic properties are considered to be closely related to cytoskeletal structure. Spherical cells upon detachment, even those that had been exposed to shear stress for 24 h, did not show such significant changes in viscoelastic mechanical properties.},

Electron micrographs show shorter, more irregular filaments for glutaraldehyde-treated F-actin in the absence of tropomyosin as compared to the presence of tropomyosin or untreated controls. There was a 40\% drop in viscosity of glutaraldehyde-treated F-actin solutions but a 90\% increase in viscosity for the glutaraldehyde-treated F-actin-tropomyosin complex in solution, as compared to the untreated controls, indicating different effects of cross-linking. SDS gels indicate that intrasubunit cross-links are introduced into F-actin and that when tropomyosin is present, intramolecular cross-link formation is inhibited. Inhibition of the salt-induced G leads to F polymerization results when intramolecular cross-links are introduced into G-actin under similar or milder reaction conditions. These data indicate that, under conditions for which extensive F-actin filament cross-linking (fixing) occurs, the filaments become damaged due to the concurrent formation of intrasubunit cross-links that cause local depolymerization and distortion and that tropomyosin protects against this damage.},

@article{Oldenburg2004,
abstract = {Bradykinin (BK) mimics ischemic preconditioning by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). To identify intermediate steps that lead to ROS generation, rabbit cardiomyocytes were incubated in reduced MitoTracker Red stain, which becomes fluorescent after exposure to ROS. Fluorescence intensity in treated cells was expressed as a percentage of that in paired, untreated cells. BK (500 nM) caused a 51 +/- 16\% increase in ROS generation (P < 0.001). Coincubation with either the BK B2-receptor blocker HOE-140 (5 microM) or the free radical scavenger N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine (1 mM) prevented this increase, which confirms that the response was receptor mediated and ROS were actually being measured. Closing mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ (mitoKATP) channels with 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD, 1 mM) prevented increased ROS generation. BK-induced ROS generation was blocked by Nomega-nitro-m-arginine methyl ester (m-NAME, 200 microM), which implicates nitric oxide as an intermediate. Blockade of guanylyl cyclase with 1-H-[1,2,4]oxadiazole[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ, 10 microM) aborted BK-induced ROS generation but not that from diazoxide, a direct opener of mitoKATP channels. The protein kinase G (PKG) blocker 8-bromoguanosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate (25 microM) eliminated the effects of BK. Conversely, direct activation of PKG with 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-guanosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (100 microM) increased ROS generation (39 +/- 15\%; P < 0.004) similar to BK. This increase was blocked by 5-HD. Finally, the nitric oxide donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (1 microM) increased ROS by 34 +/- 6\%. This increase was also blocked by 5-HD. In intact rabbit hearts, BK (400 nM) decreased infarction from 30.5 +/- 3.0 of the risk zone in control hearts to 11.9 +/- 1.4\% (P < 0.01). This protection was aborted by either 200 microM m-NAME or 2 microM ODQ (35.4 +/- 5.7 and 30.4 +/- 3.0\% infarction, respectively; P = not significant vs. control). Hence, BK preconditions through receptor-mediated production of nitric oxide, which activates guanylyl cyclase. The resulting cGMP activates PKG, which opens mitoKATP. Subsequent release of ROS triggers cardioprotection.},

Moreover, the drag factor b(h) defined as Fd/v rose when the cantilever approached the substrate. Thus, the hydrodynamic drag exhibited locally a pure viscous behavior.

Thus, correction of the hydrodynamic artifact with drag factor measured a few micrometers above the surface could result in substantial errors in AFM microrheological measurements of soft samples. Our results suggest that drag artifact in contact microrheological measurements under low Re can be accurately estimated by b(0). Precise correction of drag artifact could lead to an improvement in scan speed in contact AFM imaging and in pulling speed in force spectroscopy studies},

abstract = {Consistent with its classification as a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzyme the constitutive endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) can be activated by receptor-dependent and -independent agonists as a consequence of an increase in the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and the association of the Ca2+/calmodulin complex with eNOS. Additional post-translational mechanisms regulate the activity of eNOS, including the interaction of eNOS with caveolin-1, heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), or membrane phospholipids, as well as enzyme translocation and phosphorylation. In response to fluid shear stress the maintained production of NO by native and cultured endothelial cells is associated with only a transient increase in [Ca2+]i. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and in the presence of calmodulin antagonists, shear stress stimulates a maintained production of NO which is insensitive to the removal of extracellular Ca2+, but sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, Hsp90-binding proteins and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors. A pharmacologically identical activation of eNOS can be induced by protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors suggesting that the phosphorylation of eNOS, and possibly that of an associated regulatory protein(s), is crucial for its Ca(2+)-independent activation.},

When grown in sparse culture with no cell-cell contacts, fibroblasts and endothelial cells show an abrupt change in spread area that occurs at a stiffness range around 3,000 Pa. No actin stress fibers are seen in fibroblasts on soft surfaces, and the appearance of stress fibers is abrupt and complete at a stiffness range coincident with that at which they spread. Upregulation of alpha5 integrin also occurs in the same stiffness range, but exogenous expression of alpha5 integrin is not sufficient to cause cell spreading on soft surfaces. Neutrophils, in contrast, show no dependence of either resting shape or ability to spread after activation when cultured on surfaces as soft as 2 Pa compared to glass. The shape and cytoskeletal differences evident in single cells on soft compared to hard substrates are eliminated when fibroblasts or endothelial cells make cell-cell contact. These results support the hypothesis that mechanical factors impact different cell types in fundamentally different ways, and can trigger specific changes similar to those stimulated by soluble ligands.},

abstract = {Fluid and electrolyte balance in the human organism is controlled by aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid hormone of the suprarenal glands. The major target cells are localized in the kidney where the hormone controls transepithelial salt transport. Over the past few years, evidence has been accumulated that cells of the cardiovascular system are also targeted by the hormone. As an example, endothelial cells resemble similar mechanisms triggered by aldosterone as shown for the kidney. Although the pathological alterations induced by aldosterone excess are obvious, the physiological changes are largely unknown. On the basis of recent experiments, using atomic force microscopy as an imaging tool and a mechanical sensor, I present a hypothesis on the physiological role of aldosterone in endothelial function and its potential implications in the control of blood pressure.},

abstract = {Fabrication of cellular constructs with spatial control of cell location (+/-5 microm) is essential to the advancement of a wide range of applications including tissue engineering, stem cell and cancer research. Precise cell placement, especially of multiple cell types in co- or multi-cultures and in three dimensions, can enable research possibilities otherwise impossible, such as the cell-by-cell assembly of complex cellular constructs. Laser-based direct writing, a printing technique first utilized in electronics applications, has been adapted to transfer living cells and other biological materials (e.g., enzymes, proteins and bioceramics). Many different cell types have been printed using laser-based direct writing, and this technique offers significant improvements when compared to conventional cell patterning techniques. The predominance of work to date has not been in application of the technique, but rather focused on demonstrating the ability of direct writing to pattern living cells, in a spatially precise manner, while maintaining cellular viability. This paper reviews laser-based additive direct-write techniques for cell printing, and the various cell types successfully laser direct-written that have applications in tissue engineering, stem cell and cancer research are highlighted. A particular focus is paid to process dynamics modeling and process-induced cell injury during laser-based cell direct writing.},

abstract = {The luminal surface of endothelial cells is lined with the glycocalyx, a network structure of glycoproteins probably 50 to 100 nm thick. It has been suggested that a relatively regular fibre-matrix structure may be responsible for the ultrafiltration properties of microvascular walls, both when the endothelium is continuous and when it is fenestrated. Positive structural evidence demonstrating an underlying periodicity in the glycocalyx has been hard to obtain. Here we present structural analysis of glycocalyx samples prepared in a variety of ways for electron microscopy. Using computed autocorrelation functions and Fourier transforms of representative areas of the electron micrograph images, we show that there is an underlying three-dimensional fibrous meshwork within the glycocalyx with characteristic spacings of about 20 nm. Together with a fibre diameter consistent with our observations of about 10-12 nm, the 20-nm spacing provides just the size regime to account satisfactorily for the observed molecular filtering; the observations are consistent with the fibre matrix model. We also show that the fibrous elements may occur in clusters with a common intercluster spacing of about 100 nm and speculate that this may reveal organisation of the glycocalyx by a quasi-regular submembranous cytoskeletal scaffold.},

abstract = {Dietary sodium and potassium contribute to the control of the blood pressure. Endothelial cells are targets for aldosterone, which activates the apically located epithelial sodium channels. The activity of these channels is negatively correlated with the release of nitric oxide (NO) and determines endothelial function. A mediating factor between channel activity and NO release is the mechanical stiffness of the cell's plasma membrane, including the submembranous actin network (the cell's 'shell'). Changes in plasma sodium and potassium, within the physiological range, regulate the viscosity of this shell and thus control the shear-stress-dependent activity of the endothelial NO synthase located in the shell's 'pockets' (caveolae). High plasma sodium gelates the shell of the endothelial cell, whereas the shell is fluidized by high potassium. Accordingly, this concept envisages that communications between extracellular ions and intracellular enzymes occur at the plasma membrane barrier, whereas 90\% of the total cell mass remains uninvolved in these changes. Endothelial cells are highly sensitive to extracellular sodium and potassium. This sensitivity may serve as a physiological feedback mechanism to regulate local blood flow. It may also have pathophysiological relevance when sodium/potassium homeostasis is disturbed.},

However, epidemiological and prospective data support a long-term influence of early metabolic control on clinical outcomes. This phenomenon has recently been defined as "metabolic memory." Potential mechanisms for propagating this "memory" may be the production of reactive species unrelated to the presence of hyperglycemia, depending on the previous production of AGEs which can maintain RAGE over-expression, on the level of glycation of mitochondrial proteins and on the amount of mtDNA produced, all conditions able to induce an altered gene expression which may be persistent even when glycemia is normalized. Clinically, the emergence of this "metabolic memory" suggests the need for a very early aggressive treatment aiming to "normalize" the metabolic control and the addition of agents which reduce cellular reactive species and glycation in addition to normalizing glucose levels in diabetic patients in order to minimize long-term diabetic complications.},

@article{Savoia2006,
abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review we summarize the recent evidence that highlights the involvement of low-grade inflammation in the development and pathophysiology of hypertension.

RECENT FINDINGS: Essential hypertension is characterized by increased peripheral vascular resistance to blood flow, due in large part to vascular remodeling. Vascular changes in hypertension are associated with mechanical and humoral factors that modulate signaling events, resulting in abnormal function, media growth, extracellular matrix deposition and inflammation. Recent evidence suggests that inflammation is present in the vasculature in animal models of hypertension. Inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein, are associated with vascular lesions in humans, and are predictive of cardiovascular outcome. In animal and human studies, pro-inflammatory components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have been demonstrated in large conduit and small arteries in the kidney and heart. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor activators are drugs with metabolic properties that have been demonstrated to exert anti-inflammatory effects on the vasculature, and there is now evidence that these actions may be protective for blood vessels.

SUMMARY: Inflammatory processes are important participants in the pathophysiology of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The identification of the mechanisms leading to the activation of inflammation should contribute to the development of specific therapeutic approaches to apply in hypertension and its complications.},

The data were consistent with a residual film in the contact region having a thickness of ∼6 nm following an extended dwell time before separation of the probe. It was possible to estimate the maximum adhesive force as a function of the capillary number, Ca, by applying existing theoretical models based on capillary interactions and viscous flow except at large values of Ca in the case of viscoelastic fluids, for which it was necessary to develop a nonlinear viscoelastic model. The compliance of the atomic force microscope colloid beam was an important factor in governing the retraction velocity of the probe and therefore the value of the adhesive force, but the inertia of the beam and viscoelastic stress overshoot effects were not significant in the range of separation velocities investigated.},

abstract = {The growth of stem cells can be modulated by physical factors such as extracellular matrix nanotopography. We hypothesize that nanotopography modulates cell behavior by changing the integrin clustering and focal adhesion (FA) assembly, leading to changes in cytoskeletal organization and cell mechanical properties. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) cultured on 350 nm gratings of tissue-culture polystyrene (TCPS) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) showed decreased expression of integrin subunits alpha2, alpha , alpha V, beta2, beta 3 and beta 4 compared to the unpatterned controls. On gratings, the elongated hMSCs exhibited an aligned actin cytoskeleton, while on unpatterned controls, spreading cells showed a random but denser actin cytoskeleton network. Expression of cytoskeleton and FA components was also altered by the nanotopography as reflected in the mechanical properties measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation. On the rigid TCPS, hMSCs on gratings exhibited lower instantaneous and equilibrium Young's moduli and apparent viscosity. On the softer PDMS, the effects of nanotopography were not significant. However, hMSCs cultured on PDMS showed lower cell mechanical properties than those on TCPS, regardless of topography. These suggest that both nanotopography and substrate stiffness could be important in determining mechanical properties, while nanotopography may be more dominant in determining the organization of the cytoskeleton and FAs.},

abstract = {We report a steady-state theory for the evaluation of electrostatic interactions between identical or dissimilar spherical soft multi-layered (bio)particles, e.g. microgels or microorganisms. These generally consist of a rigid core surrounded by concentric ion-permeable layers that may differ in thickness, soft material density, chemical composition and degree of dissociation for the ionogenic groups. The formalism allows the account of diffuse interphases where distributions of ionogenic groups from one layer to the other are position-dependent. The model is valid for any number of ion-permeable layers around the core of the interacting soft particles and covers all limiting situations in terms of nature of interacting particles, i.e. homo- and hetero-interactions between hard, soft or entirely porous colloids. The theory is based on a rigorous numerical solution of the non-linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation including radial and angular distortions of the electric field distribution within and outside the interacting soft particles in approach. The Gibbs energy of electrostatic interaction is obtained from a general expression derived following the method by Verwey and Overbeek based on appropriate electric double layer charging mechanisms. Original analytical solutions are provided here for cases where interaction takes place between soft multi-layered particles whose size and charge density are in line with Deryagin treatment and Debye-H\"{u}ckel approximation. These situations include interactions between hard and soft particles, hard plate and soft particle or soft plate and soft particle. The flexibility of the formalism is highlighted by the discussion of few situations which clearly illustrate that electrostatic interaction between multi-layered particles may be partly or predominantly governed by potential distribution within the most internal layers. A major consequence is that both amplitude and sign of Gibbs electrostatic interaction energy may dramatically change depending on the interplay between characteristic Debye length, thickness of ion-permeable layers and their respective protolytic features (e.g. location, magnitude and sign of charge density). This formalism extends a recent model by Ohshima which is strictly limited to interaction between soft mono-shell particles within Deryagin and Debye-H\"{u}ckel approximations under conditions where ionizable sites are completely dissociated.},

abstract = {An electrochemical theory of the glycocalyx surface layer on capillary endothelial cells is developed as a model to study the electrochemical dynamics of anionic molecular transport within capillaries. Combining a constitutive relationship for electrochemical transport, derived from Fick's and Ohm's laws, with the conservation of mass and Gauss's law from electrostatics, a system of three nonlinear, coupled, second-order, partial, integro-differential equations is obtained for the concentrations of the diffusing anionic molecules and the cations and anions in the blood. With the exception of small departures from electroneutrality that arise locally near the apical region of the glycocalyx, the model assumes that cations in the blood counterbalance the fixed negative charges bound to the macromolecular matrix of the glycocalyx in equilibrium. In the presence of anionic molecular tracers injected into the capillary lumen, the model predicts the size- and charge-dependent electrophoretic mobility of ions and tracers within the layer. In particular, the model predicts that anionic molecules are excluded from the glycocalyx at equilibrium and that the extent of this exclusion, which increases with increasing tracer and/or glycocalyx electronegativity, is a fundamental determinant of anionic molecular transport through the layer. The model equations were integrated numerically using a Crank-Nicolson finite-difference scheme and Newton-Raphson iteration. When the concentration of the anionic molecular tracer is small compared with the concentration of ions in the blood, a linearized version of the model can be obtained and solved as an eigenvalue problem. The results of the linear and nonlinear models were found to be in good agreement for this physiologically important case. Furthermore, if the fixed-charge density of the glycocalyx is of the order of the concentration of ions in the blood, or larger, or if the magnitude of the anionic molecular valence is large, a closed-form asymptotic solution for the diffusion time can be obtained from the eigenvalue problem that compares favorably with the numerical solution. In either case, if leakage of anionic molecules out of the capillary occurs, diffusion time is seen to vary exponentially with anionic valence and in inverse proportion to the steady-state anionic tracer concentration in the layer relative to the lumen. These findings suggest several methods for obtaining an estimate of the glycocalyx fixed-charge density in vivo.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: 17beta-estradiol is known to delay the onset of atherosclerosis in women but cellular mechanisms are still unclear. Estrogens bind to specific receptors and initiate a signaling cascade that involves the activation of plasma membrane Na(+)/H(+) exchange. We hypothesized that estrogens interfere with ion transport across the plasma membrane and thus control endothelial structure and function. Therefore, we investigated the effects of the sex steroids 17beta-estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone on volume, apical surface and elasticity in human endothelium. METHODS: The atomic force microscope was used as an imaging tool and as an elasticity sensor. We applied the antiestrogen tamoxifen, the Na(+)/H(+) exchange blocker cariporide and the epithelial Na(+)channel blocker amiloride to elucidate the role of transmembrane ion transport in hormone-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). RESULTS: Incubation with 17beta-estradiol for 72 h led to a dose-dependent increase of endothelial cell volume (41\%), apical cell surface (22\%), and cell elasticity (53\%) as compared to non-17beta-estradiol treated controls. Block of the 17beta-estradiol receptor by tamoxifen and of plasma membrane Na(+)/H(+) exchange by cariporide prevented the hormone-induced changes. Progesterone and testosterone were ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: 17beta-estradiol increases HUVEC water content and HUVEC elasticity mediated by activated estrogen receptors. The estrogen response depends on the activation of plasma membrane Na(+)/H(+) exchange. The increase in endothelial cell elasticity could be one of the vasoprotective mechanisms postulated for 17beta-estradiol.},

abstract = {Endotoxemia is associated with changed pulmonary vascular function with respect to vasoreactivity, endothelial permeability, and activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase II (NOSII). However, whether altered passive arterial wall mechanics contribute to this endotoxin-induced pulmonary vascular dysfunction is still unknown. Therefore, we investigated whether endotoxin affects the passive arterial mechanics and compliance of isolated rat pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary arteries of pentobarbital-anesthetized Wistar rats (n = 55) were isolated and exposed to Escherichia coli endotoxin (50 microg/ml) for 20 h. Endotoxin increased pulmonary artery diameter and compliance (transmural pressure = 13 mmHg) in an endothelium-, Ca2+-, or NOSII-induced NO release-independent manner. Interestingly, the endotoxin-induced alterations in the passive arterial mechanics were accompanied by disassembly of the smooth muscle cell (SMC) F-actin cytoskeleton. Disassembly of F-actin by incubation of control arteries with the cytoskeleton-disrupting agent cytochalasin B or the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 induced a similar increase in passive arterial diameter and compliance. In contrast, RhoA activation by lysophosphatidic acid prevented the endotoxin-induced alterations in the pulmonary SMC F-actin cytoskeleton and passive mechanics. In conclusion, these findings indicate that disassembly of the SMC F-actin cytoskeleton and RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling act as mediators of endotoxin-induced changes in the pulmonary arterial mechanics. They imply the involvement of F-actin rearrangement and RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling in endotoxemia-induced vascular lung injury.},

Infiltration of LPS on HUVEC membrane was studied by observation with confocal microscopy and fluorescent microscopy. Results showed that LPS direct injuring HUVEC can cause the changes of HUVEC biomechanical properties and membrane lipid contents; HUVEC directly damage by LPS could also activate HUVEC phospholipase A2 (PLA2), influencing membrane lipid metabolism; LPS could directly infiltrate and intercalate HUVEC membrane, causing and membrane contents variation.

abstract = {Mechanical properties of living cells can be determined using atomic force microscopy (AFM). In this study, a novel analysis was developed to determine the mechanical properties of adherent monolayers of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) using AFM and finite element modeling, which considers both the finite thickness of ECs and their nonlinear elastic properties, as well as the large strain induced by AFM. Comparison of this model with the more traditional Hertzian model, which assumes linear elastic behavior, small strains, and infinite cell thickness, suggests that the new analysis can predict the mechanical response of ECs during AFM indentation better than Hertz's model, especially when using force-displacement data obtained from large indentations (>100 nm). The shear moduli and distensibility of ECs were greater when using small indentations (<100 nm) compared to large indentations (>100 nm). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced changes in the mechanical properties of ECs, which included a decrease in the average shear moduli that occurred in all regions of the ECs and an increase in distensibility in the central regions when measured using small indentations. These changes can be modeled as changes in a chain network structure within the ECs.},

abstract = {Summary The atomic force microscope (AFM) has provided nanoscale analyses of surfaces of cells that exhibit strong adhesive and cell spreading properties. However, it is frequently reported that prior fixation is required for reliable imaging of cells with lower adhesive properties. In the present study, the AFM is used to assess the effects of fixation by glutaraldehyde on the elastic modulus of a human rhabdomyosarcoma transfectant cell line RDX2C2. Our results show a sharp increase in the elastic modulus for even mild fixation (0.5\% glutaraldehyde for 60 s), accompanied by a dramatic improvement in imaging reproducibility. An even larger increase is seen in NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts, although in that case fixation is not typically necessary for successful imaging. In addition, our results suggest that treatment with glutaraldehyde restricts the content of the resulting images to features nearer to the cell surface.},

abstract = {The lack of practicable nonlinear elastic contact models frequently compels the inappropriate use of Hertzian models in analyzing indentation data and likely contributes to inconsistencies associated with the results of biological atomic force microscopy measurements. We derived and validated with the aid of the finite element method force-indentation relations based on a number of hyperelastic strain energy functions. The models were applied to existing data from indentation, using microspheres as indenters, of synthetic rubber-like gels, native mouse cartilage tissue, and engineered cartilage. For the biological tissues, the Fung and single-term Ogden models achieved the best fits of the data while all tested hyperelastic models produced good fits for the synthetic gels. The Hertz model proved to be acceptable for the synthetic gels at small deformations (strain < 0.05 for the samples tested), but not for the biological tissues. Although this finding supports the generally accepted view that many soft materials can be assumed to be linear elastic at small deformations, the nonlinear models facilitate analysis of intrinsically nonlinear tissues and large-strain indentation behavior.},

abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a highly successful technique for imaging nanometre-sized samples and measuring pico- to nano-newton forces acting between atoms and molecules. When it comes to the manipulation of larger samples with forces of tens and hundreds of nano-newtons, however, the present chemistry-based modification protocols for functionalizing AFM cantilevers to achieve the formation of covalent/non-covalent linkages between the AFM probe and the sample surface do not produce strong enough bonds. For the purpose of measuring the fracture strength and other mechanical properties of stress fibres (SFs) in living as well as semi-intact fibroblast cells, we fabricated an AFM probe with a hooking function by focused ion beam technology and used the AFM probe hook to capture, pull and eventually sever a chosen SF labelled with green or red fluorescent protein.},

@article{Schaffer2012,
abstract = {Oxidative stress is recognized as a key participant in the development of diabetic complications in the vasculature. One of the seminal studies advancing the role of oxidative stress in vascular endothelial cells proposed that oxidative stress-mediated diversion of glycolytic intermediates into pathological pathways was a key underlying element in the development of diabetic complications. It is widely recognized that flux through glycolysis slows during diabetes. However, several bottlenecks develop in the glycolytic pathway, including glucose transport, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase. Of these limiting steps in glycolysis, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is most sensitive to oxidative stress, leading to the hypothesis that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate inactivation by ribosylation underlies the diversion of glycolytic intermediates into pathological pathways. However, recent studies question the mechanism underlying the effect of reactive oxygen species on key enzymes of the glycolytic pathway. The present review critiques the major premises of the hypothesis and concludes that further study of the role of oxidative stress in the development of diabetes-mediated vasculature dysfunction is warranted.},

abstract = {Cell printing has been popularized over the past few years as a revolutionary advance in tissue engineering has potentially enabled heterogeneous 3-D scaffolds to be built cell-by-cell. This review article summarizes the state-of-the-art cell printing techniques that utilize fluid jetting phenomena to deposit 2- and 3-D patterns of living eukaryotic cells. There are four distinct categories of jetbased approaches to printing cells. Laser guidance direct write (LG DW) was the first reported technique to print viable cells by forming patterns of embryonic-chick spinal-cord cells on a glass slide (1999). Shortly after this, modified laser-induced forward transfer techniques (LIFT) and modified ink jet printers were also used to print viable cells, followed by the most recent demonstration using an electrohydrodynamic jetting (EHDJ) method. The low cost of some of these printing technologies has spurred debate as to whether they could be used on a large scale to manufacture tissue and possibly even whole organs. This review summarizes the published results of these cell printers (cell viability, retained genotype and phenotype), and also includes a physical description of the various jetting processes with a discussion of the stresses and forces that may be encountered by cells during printing. We conclude the review by comparing and contrasting the different jet-based techniques, while providing a map for future experiments that could lead to significant advances in the field of tissue engineering.},

abstract = {Diperoxovanadate (DPV), a potent inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases and activator of tyrosine kinases, alters endothelial barrier function via signaling pathways that are incompletely understood. One potential pathway is Src kinase-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins such as cortactin that regulate endothelial cell (EC) cytoskeleton assembly. As DPV modulates endothelial cell signaling via protein tyrosine phosphorylation, we determined the role of DPV-induced intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in activation of Src kinase, cytoskeletal remodeling, and barrier function in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAECs). DPV in a dose- and time-dependent fashion increased [Ca2+]i, which was partially blocked by the calcium channel blockers nifedipine and Gd3+. Treatment of cells with thapsigargin released Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum, and subsequent addition of DPV caused no further change in [Ca2+]i. These data suggest that DPV-induced [Ca2+]i includes Ca release from the endoplasmic reticulum and Ca influx through store-operated calcium entry. Furthermore, DPV induced an increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphorylation of Src and cortactin, actin remodeling, and altered transendothelial electrical resistance in BPAECs. These DPV-mediated effects were significantly attenuated by BAPTA (25 microM), a chelator of [Ca2+]i. Immunofluorescence studies reveal that the DPV-mediated colocalization of cortactin with peripheral actin was also prevented by BAPTA. Chelation of extracellular Ca2+ by EGTA had marginal effects on DPV-induced phosphorylation of Src and cortactin; actin stress fibers formation, however, affected EC barrier function. These data suggest that DPV-induced changes in [Ca2+]i regulate endothelial barrier function using signaling pathways that involve Src and cytoskeleton remodeling.},

abstract = {Oxygen-derived free radicals are thought to contribute to the initiation and progression of cardiovascular disease via several different mechanisms, such as consumption of nitric oxide, oxidation of proteins and lipids, and activation of redox-sensitive signalling cascades. Vascular NADPH oxidases are important sources of vascular radical formation. The activities of these enzymes, which in some aspects are similar to the leukocyte NADPH oxidase, are controlled on the expression level and complex activation mechanisms. As a plethora of vascular stimuli, such as growth factors, cytokines, physical stimuli, and lipids elicits radical formation by these enzymes, a careful analysis is required for the understanding of the activation of the NADPH oxidases. This article reviews the components of the NADPH oxidases in leukocytes and vascular tissue. Emphasis is put on the activation of the oxidases, including upstream signalling events and molecular modes of interaction between the subunits.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aldosterone has long been known to control water and electrolyte balance by acting on mineralocorticoid receptors in kidney. However, recent studies identified these classic receptors also in the vascular system. Indeed, aldosterone alters structure and function of human endothelium. We applied nanotechniques to detect these changes. METHODS: Experiments were performed in cultured monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Ten nanomoles per liter aldosterone or solvent (control) was added to the culture medium for 72 hours. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used as a nanotool that physically interacts with the cell surface. In the monolayer we measured cell volume, apical cell surface, and cell stiffness. RESULTS: Volume, apical surface area, and stiffness of individual cells increased in response to aldosterone by 18\% (P < 0.05), 64\% (P < 0.001), and 78\% (P < 0.01), respectively. Imaging of the cell-to-cell contacts disclosed gaps in response to aldosterone. Furthermore, underneath the monolayer we detected an aldosterone-induced increase of protein deposition by 58\% (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Aldosterone remodels human endothelium in vitro. Cells increase in size and stiffness. Protein leakage through intercellular gaps could be caused by the increased apical membrane tension. The increase in cell rigidity could trigger endothelial dysfunction observed in hyperaldosteronism.},

abstract = {To assess the extent to which the progression of diabetic retinopathy can be arrested by improved glycemic control, 35 normal dogs were randomly divided into a nondiabetic and three alloxan-induced diabetic groups prospectively identified according to glycemic control: poor control for 5 yr (PC), good control for 5 yr (GC), and poor control for 2.5 yr followed by good control for 2.5 yr (PGC). To achieve good control, insulin was given twice daily together with a measured diet so that hyperglycemia and glucosuria were mild and infrequent, and HbA1 was comparable to normal. Retinal capillary aneurysms and other lesions developed during 60 mo of poor control (group PC) and were inhibited if good control was begun promptly within 2 mo (group GC). In group PGC, retinopathy was absent or equivocal at 2.5 yr of poor control and, surprisingly, was found to develop subsequently despite good glycemic control. Retinopathy in group PGC was greater at autopsy than at 2.5 yr and was greater than in group GC. The results indicate that retinopathy may be preventable but tends to resist arrest even in its incipient stages, before more than the first few aneurysms have appeared.},

abstract = {Cadherins are a family of transmembrane glycoproteins mediating calcium-dependent, homophilic cell-cell adhesion. In addition, these molecules are involved in signaling events, regulating such processes as cell motility, proliferation, and apoptosis. Members of the cadherin subfamily, called either classical or type I cadherins, contain a highly conserved sequence at their homophilic binding site consisting of the three amino acids--histidine-alanine-valine (HAV). Previous studies have shown that peptides containing the HAV motif inhibit cadherin-dependent events such as cell aggregation, compaction, and neurite outgrowth. We report here that a cyclic peptide, N-Ac-CHAVC-NH2 can perturb cadherin-mediated endothelial cell interactions, resulting in a progressive apoptotic cell death. This effect depends on cell density, as it is only observed when dense cultures are treated with the peptide. Adherens junction (AJ)-associated cadherin and catenins are differentially affected by the N-Ac-CHAVC-NH2 treatment, as judged by double immunofluorescence labeling followed by immunofluorescence-ratio imaging. However, cell-cell adhesions are largely retained during the first few hours after addition of the peptide. It was also observed that following treatment, actin filaments partially lose their plasma membrane anchorage at AJs and translocate towards the cell center. Interestingly, addition of basic fibroblast growth factor to confluent, peptide-treated, endothelial cell cultures, completely blocks apoptosis and the inhibitory peptide reduce the phosphorylation of the FGF receptor target protein FRS2, suggesting that the peptide exerts its effect by inhibiting cadherin-mediated activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling. We propose that cadherin-mediated signaling is essential for maintaining viability of confluent endothelial cells, and that its perturbation by N-Ac-CHAVC-NH2 drives these cells to apoptosis.},

abstract = {It is evident that metabolic memory, whereby diabetic complications continue to develop and progress in individuals who returned to normal glycemic control after a period of transient hyperglycemia, can have long lasting effects. We have primary findings that transient hyperglycemia causes profound transcriptional changes in vascular endothelial cells. We hypothesized that ambient hyperglycemia triggers gene-activating events of the NF$\kappa$B p65 promoter that are mediated by changes in epigenetic modifications. In a follow-up study we identified two histone-specific writing and erasing enzymes involved in the underlying regulation of gene expression during transient hyperglycemia and subsequent return to normoglycemia. Experimental evidence indicates that previous hyperglycemia is associated with persistent expression of the NF$\kappa$B p65 gene, which activates NF$\kappa$B-dependent proteins, such as MCP-1, which are implicated in diabetes-associated vascular injury. Increased gene transcription is correspondent with H3K4m1, but not H3K4m2 and H3K4m3, on the NF$\kappa$B p65 gene. In vascular endothelial cells the histone methyltransferase Set7 can write the mono-methylation mark H3K4m1 and this methyl-writing enzyme is recruited as a gene co-activator in response to glucose. Furthermore, Set7 knockdown prevents glucose-induced p65 expression. We hypothesize that these molecular events represent an integrated response of the epigenome that lead to changes in the expression of genes and proteins that regulate the development and progression of diabetic vascular complications. Further characterisation of these glucose-induced epigenetic events and the identification of key enzymes involved will improve our understanding of the pathways implicated in diabetic vascular injury.},

In this work, an elastic continuum model is implemented to treat the deformation of spherical cells in solution due to their interaction with cylindrical probes. At small deformations, the force varies nonlinearly with indentation due to global deformation of the cell shape. However, at large indentations, the force varies linearly with indentation due to more localized deformations. These trends are consistent with experimental measurements under comparable conditions and can be used to develop design rules for optimizing probe-cell interactions.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial dysfunction is a prominent feature of most cardiovascular diseases. Angiotensin (Ang) II is an important stimulus for atherogenesis and hypertension; however, its effects on mitochondrial function remain unknown. We hypothesized that Ang II could induce mitochondrial oxidative damage that in turn might decrease endothelial nitric oxide (NO.) bioavailability and promote vascular oxidative stress. The effect of Ang II on mitochondrial ROS, mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, glutathione, and endothelial NO. was studied in isolated mitochondria and intact bovine aortic endothelial cells using electron spin resonance, dihydroethidium high-performance liquid chromatography -based assay, Amplex Red and cationic dye fluorescence. Ang II significantly increased mitochondrial H2O2 production. This increase was blocked by preincubation of intact cells with apocynin (NADPH oxidase inhibitor), uric acid (scavenger of peroxynitrite), chelerythrine (protein kinase C inhibitor), N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), 5-hydroxydecanoate (mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels inhibitor), or glibenclamide. Depletion of p22(phox) subunit of NADPH oxidase with small interfering RNA also inhibited Ang II-mediated mitochondrial ROS production. Ang II depleted mitochondrial glutathione, increased state 4 and decreased state 3 respirations, and diminished mitochondrial respiratory control ratio. These responses were attenuated by apocynin, 5-hydroxydecanoate, and glibenclamide. In addition, 5-hydroxydecanoate prevented the Ang II-induced decrease in endothelial NO. and mitochondrial membrane potential. Therefore, Ang II induces mitochondrial dysfunction via a protein kinase C-dependent pathway by activating the endothelial cell NADPH oxidase and formation of peroxynitrite. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction in response to Ang II modulates endothelial NO. and generation, which in turn has ramifications for development of endothelial dysfunction.},

abstract = {The hexosamine pathway provides UDP-N:-acetylhexosamine donor substrates used in cytosolic and Golgi-mediated glycosylation of proteins and for formation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which tether proteins to the outer plasma membrane. We have recently identified the murine glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P) acetyltransferase, EMeg32, as a developmentally regulated enzyme on the route to UDP-N:-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). Here we describe embryos and cells that have the EMeg32 gene inactivated by homologous recombination. Homozygous mutant embryos die at around embryonic day (E) 7.5 with a general proliferative delay of development. In vitro differentiated EMeg32(-/-) ES cells show reduced proliferation. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient for EMeg32 exhibit defects in proliferation and adhesiveness, which could be complemented by stable re-expression of EMeg32 or by nutritional restoration of intracellular UDP-GlcNAc levels. Reduced UDP-GlcNAc levels predominantly translated into decreased O-GlcNAc modifications of cytosolic and nuclear proteins. Interestingly, growth-impaired EMeg32(-/-) MEFs withstand a number of apoptotic stimuli and express activated PKB/AKT. Thus, EMeg32-dependent UDP-GlcNAc levels influence cell cycle progression and susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli.},

abstract = {The cytoskeleton is the physical and biochemical interface for a large variety of cellular processes. Its complex regulation machinery is involved upstream and downstream in various signaling pathways. The cytoskeleton determines the mechanical properties of a cell. Thus, cell elasticity could serve as a parameter reflecting the behavior of the system rather than reflecting the specific properties of isolated components. In this study, we used atomic force microscopy to perform real-time monitoring of cell elasticity unveiling cytoskeletal dynamics of living bronchial epithelial cells. In resting cells, we found a periodic activity of the cytoskeleton. Amplitude and frequency of this spontaneous oscillation were strongly affected by intracellular calcium. Experiments reveal that basal cell elasticity and superimposed elasticity oscillations are caused by the collective action of myosin motor proteins. We characterized the cell as a mechanically multilayered structure, and followed cytoskeletal dynamics in the different layers with high time resolution. In conclusion, the collective activities of the myosin motor proteins define overall mechanical cell dynamics, reflecting specific changes of the chemical and mechanical environment.},

@article{Singer1972,
abstract = {A fluid mosaic model is presented for the gross organization and structure of the proteins and lipids of biological membranes. The model is consistent with the restrictions imposed by thermodynamics. In this model, the proteins that are integral to the membrane are a heterogeneous set of globular molecules, each arranged in an amphipathic structure, that is, with the ionic and highly polar groups protruding from the membrane into the aqueous phase, and the nonpolar groups largely buried in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. These globular molecules are partially embedded in a matrix of phospholipid. The bulk of the phospholipid is organized as a discontinuous, fluid bilayer, although a small fraction of the lipid may interact specifically with the membrane proteins. The fluid mosaic structure is therefore formally analogous to a two-dimensional oriented solution of integral proteins (or lipoproteins) in the viscous phospholipid bilayer solvent. Recent experiments with a wide variety of techniqes and several different membrane systems are described, all of which abet consistent with, and add much detail to, the fluid mosaic model. It therefore seems appropriate to suggest possible mechanisms for various membrane functions and membrane-mediated phenomena in the light of the model. As examples, experimentally testable mechanisms are suggested for cell surface changes in malignant transformation, and for cooperative effects exhibited in the interactions of membranes with some specific ligands. Note added in proof: Since this article was written, we have obtained electron microscopic evidence (69) that the concanavalin A binding sites on the membranes of SV40 virus-transformed mouse fibroblasts (3T3 cells) are more clustered than the sites on the membranes of normal cells, as predicted by the hypothesis represented in Fig. 7B. T-here has also appeared a study by Taylor et al. (70) showing the remarkable effects produced on lymphocytes by the addition of antibodies directed to their surface immunoglobulin molecules. The antibodies induce a redistribution and pinocytosis of these surface immunoglobulins, so that within about 30 minutes at 37 degrees C the surface immunoglobulins are completely swept out of the membrane. These effects do not occur, however, if the bivalent antibodies are replaced by their univalent Fab fragments or if the antibody experiments are carried out at 0 degrees C instead of 37 degrees C. These and related results strongly indicate that the bivalent antibodies produce an aggregation of the surface immunoglobulin molecules in the plane of the membrane, which can occur only if the immunoglobulin molecules are free to diffuse in the membrane. This aggregation then appears to trigger off the pinocytosis of the membrane components by some unknown mechanism. Such membrane transformations may be of crucial importance in the induction of an antibody response to an antigen, as well as iv other processes of cell differentiation.},

abstract = {In this critical review we treat the phenomenon of capillarity in nanoscopic confinement, based on application of the Young-Laplace equation. In classical capillarity the curvature of the meniscus is determined by the confining geometry and the macroscopic contact angle. We show that in narrow confinement the influence of the disjoining pressure and the related wetting films have to be considered as they may significantly change the meniscus curvature. Nanochannel based static and dynamic capillarity experiments are reviewed. A typical effect of nanoscale confinement is the appearance of capillarity induced negative pressure. Special attention is paid to elasto-capillarity and electro-capillarity. The presence of electric fields leads to an extra stress term to be added in the Young-Laplace equation. A typical example is the formation of the Taylor cone, essential in the theory of electrospray. Measurements of the filling kinetics of nanochannels with water and aqueous salt solutions are discussed. These experiments can be used to characterize viscosity and apparent viscosity effects of water in nanoscopic confinement. In the final section we show four examples of appearances of capillarity in engineering and in nature (112 references).},

The observed Raman scattering provides information about the biomolecules present near the nanoparticle probes. The results show that aggregates of nanoparticles produce spectroscopic results similar to those reported from other surface enhanced Raman spectroscopies, e.g., shell isolated nanoparticle enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) and aggregated nanoparticles; however, TERS enables the detection of isolated nanoparticles on cell membranes where the observed spectra provide information about the interaction of the specific biomolecule conjugated to the nanoparticle probe.

abstract = {This Nano Focus article reviews recent developments in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and its application to homeland security. It is based on invited talks given at the "Nanorods and Microparticles for Homeland Security" symposium, which was organized by one of the authors and presented at the 238th ACS National Meeting and Exhibition in Washington, DC. The three-day symposium included approximately 25 experts from academia, industry, and national laboratories and included both SERS and non-SERS approaches to detection of chemical and biological substances relevant to homeland security, as well as fundamental advances. Here, we focus on SERS and how it is uniquely positioned to have an impact in a field whose importance is increasing rapidly. We describe some technical challenges that remain and offer a glimpse of what form solutions might take.},

@article{Dimitriadis2002,
abstract = {We address three problems that limit the use of the atomic force microscope when measuring elastic moduli of soft materials at microscopic scales. The first concerns the use of sharp cantilever tips, which typically induce local strains that far exceed the linear material regime. We show that this problem can be alleviated by using microspheres as probes, and we establish the criteria for their use. The second relates to the common use of the Hertz contact mechanics model, which leads to significant errors when applied to thin samples. We develop novel, simple to use corrections to apply for such cases. Samples that are either bonded or not bonded to a rigid substrate are considered. The third problem concerns the difficulty in establishing when contact occurs on a soft material. We obtain error estimates for the elastic modulus resulting from such uncertainty and discuss the sensitivity of the estimation methods to error in contact point. The theoretical and experimental results are compared to macroscopic measurements on poly(vinyl-alcohol) gels.},

@article{A-Hassan1998,
abstract = {The spatial and temporal changes of the mechanical properties of living cells reflect complex underlying physiological processes. Following these changes should provide valuable insight into the biological importance of cellular mechanics and their regulation. The tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM) can be used to indent soft samples, and the force versus indentation measurement provides information about the local viscoelasticity. By collecting force-distance curves on a time scale where viscous contributions are small, the forces measured are dominated by the elastic properties of the sample. We have developed an experimental approach, using atomic force microscopy, called force integration to equal limits (FIEL) mapping, to produce robust, internally quantitative maps of relative elasticity. FIEL mapping has the advantage of essentially being independent of the tip-sample contact point and the cantilever spring constant. FIEL maps of living Madine-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells show that elasticity is uncoupled from topography and reveal a number of unexpected features. These results present a mode of high-resolution visualization in which the contrast is based on the mechanical properties of the sample.},

@article{Kolodziejczyk2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that cell elastic properties should change considerably in response to chemical agents affecting the physiological state of the endothelium. In this work, a novel assay for testing prospective endothelium-targeted agents in vitro is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The proposed methodology is based on nanoindentation spectroscopy using an atomic force microscope tip, which allows for quantitative evaluation of cell stiffness. As an example, we chose a pyridine derivative, 1-methylnicotinamide chloride (MNA), known to have antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties, as reported in recent in vivo experiments. RESULTS: First, we determined a concentration range of MNA in which physiological parameters of the endothelial cells in vitro are not affected. Then, cell dysfunction was induced by incubation with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) and the cellular response to MNA treatment after TNF-$\alpha$ incubation was studied. In parallel to the nanoindentation spectroscopy, the endothelium phenotype was characterized using a fluorescence spectroscopy with F-actin labeling, and biochemical methods, such as secretion measurements of both nitric oxide (NO), and prostacyclin (PGI2) regulatory agents. CONCLUSION: We found that MNA could reverse the dysfunction of the endothelium caused by inflammation, if applied in the proper time and to the concentration scheme established in our investigations. A surprisingly close correlation was found between effective Young's modulus of the cells and actin polymerization/depolymerization processes in the endothelium cortical cytoskeleton, as well as NO and PGI2 levels. These results allow us to construct the physiological model of sequential intracellular pathways activated in the endothelium by MNA.},

@article{Munaron2006a,
abstract = {The proliferation and motility of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are critical steps in angiogenesis and are strictly controlled by different extracellular signals. Among mitogens, peptides binding to tyrosine kinase receptors (i.e. VEGFs and FGFs) are well known and are released by several cell types, including ECs and tumor cells. The binding of mitogens to their specific receptors triggers intracellular signaling cascades, involving a number of messengers working in a sort of network. In particular, in this review we describe the increases of calcium levels in the cytosol, a universal, evolutionary conserved and highly versatile signal involved in the regulation of EC's proliferation and motility. Most mitogens, including angiogenic factors, generate cytosolic calcium rises through two mechanisms: entry from extracellular medium, through the opening of calcium permeable channels in the plasma membrane, or release from intracellular organelles (mainly endoplasmic reticulum, ER). Calcium entry, the main topic of this review, can be dependent on previously IP(3)-activated emptying of calcium stores (store-dependent or capacitative calcium entry--CCE), or independent on it (non capacitative calcium entry, NCCE). The intracellular pathways underlying calcium entry are under investigation and recently arachidonic acid (AA) and nitric oxide (NO) metabolism have been suggested to play a key role, at least in some cell types. Even if some calcium entry blockers are under clinical trial with encouraging results, a better knowledge about the molecular nature of calcium channels and their intracellular regulation, together with a more detailed description of spatiotemporal dynamics of intracellular calcium events, could lead to new and more specific strategies in therapeutical approach to cancer progression and angiogenesis.},

This has lead to a disconnection between the concept of lipid rafts as derived from biochemical and biophysical assays and their existence in the cell. Here, we compare the concept of lipid rafts as it has emerged from the study of synthetic membranes with the reality of lateral heterogeneity in biological membranes. Further application of existing tools and the development of new tools are needed to understand the dynamic heterogeneity of biological membranes.},

@article{Fels2010_trois,
abstract = {Aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid hormone mainly synthesized in the adrenal cortex, has been recognized to be a regulator of cell mechanics. Recent data from a number of laboratories implicate that, besides kidney, the cardiovascular system is an important target for aldosterone. In the endothelium, it promotes the expression of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) and modifies the morphology of cells in terms of mechanical stiffness, surface area and volume. Additionally, it renders the cells highly sensitive to small changes in extracellular sodium and potassium. In this context, the time course of aldosterone action is pivotal. In the fast (seconds to minutes), non-genomic signalling pathway vascular endothelial cells respond to aldosterone with transient swelling, softening and insertion of ENaC in the apical plasma membrane. In parallel, nitric oxide (NO) is released from the cells. In the long-term (hours), aldosterone has opposite effects: The mechanical stiffness increases, the cells shrink and NO production decreases. This leads to the conclusion that both the physiology and pathophysiology of aldosterone action in the vascular endothelium are closely related. Aldosterone, at concentrations in the physiological range and over limited time periods can stabilize blood pressure and regulate tissue perfusion while chronically high concentrations of this hormone over extended time periods impair sodium homeostasis promoting endothelial dysfunction and the development of tissue fibrosis.},

abstract = {Biomechanics is gaining relevance as complementary discipline to structural and cellular biology. The response of cells to mechanical stimuli determines cell type and function, while the spatial distribution of mechanical forces within the cells is crucial to understand cell activity. The experimental methodologies to approach cell mechanics are diverse but either they are effective in few cases or they rule out the innate cell complexity. In this regard, we have developed a simple scanning probe-based methodology that overcomes the limitations of the available methods. Stress relaxation, the decay of the force exerted by the cell surface at constant deformation, has been used to extract relaxational responses at each cellular sublocalisation and generate maps. Surprisingly, decay curves exerted by test cells are fully described by a generalized viscoelastic model that accounts for more than one simultaneously occurring relaxations. Within the range of applied forces (0.5-4nN) a slow and a fast relaxation with characteristic times of 0.1 and 1s have been detected and assigned to rearrangements of cell membrane and cytoskeleton, respectively. Relaxation time mapping of entire cells is thus promising to simultaneously detect non-uniformities in membrane and cytoskeleton and as identifying tool for cell type and disease.},

Disturbances arising from mechanical deformation are introduced as perturbations away from a nearly electroneutral equilibrium environment. Under mechanical compression of the layer, such as might occur on the passing of stiff leukocytes through capillaries, the model predicts that gradients in the electrochemical potential of the compressed layer cause a redistribution of mobile ions within the glycocalyx and a rehydration and restoration of the layer to its equilibrium dimensions. Because of the large deformations of the glycocalyx arising from passing leukocytes, nonlinear kinematics associated with finite deformations of the layer are accounted for in the theory. A pseudo-equilibrium approximation is invoked for the transport of the mobile ions that reduces the system of coupled nonlinear integro-differential equations to a single nonlinear partial differential equation that is solved numerically for the compression and recovery of the glycocalyx using a finite difference method on a fixed grid. A linearized model for small strains is also obtained as verification of the finite difference solution. Results of the asymptotic analysis agree well with the nonlinear solution in the limit of small deformations of the layer. Using existing experimental and theoretical estimates of glycocalyx properties, the glycocalyx fixed-charge density is estimated from the analysis to be approximately 1 mEq/l, i.e., we estimate that there exists approximately one fixed charge on the glycocalyx for every 100 ions in blood. Such a charge density would result in a voltage differential between the undeformed glycocalyx and the capillary lumen of approximately 0.1 mV. In addition to providing insight into the mechano-electrochemical dynamics of the layer under deformation, the model suggests several methods for obtaining improved estimates of the glycocalyx fixed-charge density and permeability in vivo.},

abstract = {The amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is usually found in the apical membrane of epithelial cells but has also recently been described in vascular endothelium. Because little is known about the regulation and cell surface density of ENaC, we studied the influence of aldosterone, spironolactone, and amiloride on its abundance in the plasma membrane of human endothelial cells. Three different methods were applied, single ENaC molecule detection in the plasma membrane, quantification by Western blotting, and cell surface imaging using atomic force microscopy. We found that aldosterone increases the surface expression of ENaC molecules by 36\% and the total cellular amount by 91\%. The aldosterone receptor antagonist spironolactone prevents these effects completely. Acute application of amiloride to aldosterone-pretreated cells led to a decline of intracellular ENaC by 84\%. We conclude that, in vascular endothelium, aldosterone induces ENaC expression and insertion into the plasma membrane. Upon functional blocking with amiloride, the channel disappears from the cell surface and from intracellular pools, indicating either rapid degradation and/or membrane pinch-off. This opens new perspectives in the regulation of ENaC expressed in the vascular endothelium.},

abstract = {Elasticity of living cells is a parameter of increasing importance in cellular physiology, and the atomic force microscope is a suitable instrument to quantitatively measure it. The principle of an elasticity measurement is to physically indent a cell with a probe, to measure the applied force, and to process this force-indentation data using an appropriate model. It is crucial to know what extent the geometry of the indenting probe influences the result. Therefore, we indented living Chinese hamster ovary cells at 37 degrees C with sharp tips and colloidal probes (spherical particle tips) of different sizes and materials. We furthermore developed an implementation of the Hertz model, which simplifies the data processing. Our results show (a) that the size of the colloidal probe does not influence the result over a wide range (radii 0.5-26 microm) and (b) indenting cells with sharp tips results in higher Young's moduli ( approximately 1,300 Pa) than using colloidal probes ( approximately 400 Pa).},

@article{Coldren2008,
abstract = {In this paper, experimentally obtained force curves on Staphylococcus aureus are compared with a previously developed model that incorporates hydrodynamic effects of extracellular polysaccharides together with the elastic response of the bacterium and cantilever. Force-displacement curves were predicted without any adjustable parameters. It is demonstrated that experimental results can be accurately described by our model, especially if viscoelastic effects of the extracellular polysaccharide layer are taken into account. Polysaccharide layer viscoelasticity was treated by means of a multimode Phan-Thien/Tanner (PTT) constitutive equation. Typical maximum relaxation times range from 0.2 to 2 s, whereas the corresponding zero-shear-rate viscosities are 6-9 Pa.s, based on published, steady-state rheological measurements on Staphylococcus aureus polysaccharide extracted from its native environment. The bacterial elastic constant is found to be in the range 0.02-0.4 N/m, corresponding to bacterial wall Young's moduli in the range of a few hundred MPa. Repeatability of measurements performed on different bacteria is found to be only fair, due to large individuum variability, whereas repetitions of measurements on the same bacterium showed high reproducibility. Improved force-indentation curve predictions are expected if transient rheological characterization of extracellular polysaccharides is available. More desirable however is the direct, in vivo rheological characterization of the extracellular polysaccharide. A model-based analysis of experimental force-indentation curves shows that appreciable further experimental improvements are still necessary to achieve this goal.},

AFM provides excellent topographical information on prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell surfaces, and the extracellular material produced by the cells. It helps to generate important data on the mechanical properties of cells, such as hardness and elasticity. AFM can also be used to measure the strength of adhesion, attraction, and repulsion forces between cells and surfaces or even between individual molecules. Additionally, by combining AFM with other complementary techniques such as fluorescence microscopy or Raman spectroscopy, the chemistry of given surface structures can be identified. This review aims to provide an update on the AFM techniques currently used in cell biology studies, along with a description of the range of recently developed research methodologies in which AFM plays a key role.},

abstract = {In this work we present a unified method to study the mechanical properties of cells using the atomic force microscope. Stress relaxation and creep compliance measurements permitted us to determine, the relaxation times, the Young moduli and the viscosity of breast cancer cells (MCF-7). The results show that the mechanical behaviour of MCF-7 cells responds to a two-layered model of similar elasticity but differing viscosity. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with an actin-depolymerising agent results in an overall decrease in both cell elasticity and viscosity, however to a different extent for each layer. The layer that undergoes the smaller decrease (36-38\%) is assigned to the cell membrane/cortex while the layer that experiences the larger decrease (70-80\%) is attributed to the cell cytoplasm. The combination of the method presented in this work, together with the approach based on stress relaxation microscopy (Moreno-Flores et al 2010 J. Biomech. 43 349-54), constitutes a unique AFM-based experimental framework to study cell mechanics. This methodology can also be extended to study the mechanical properties of biomaterials in general.},

As a consequence, there has been renewed interest in strategies that might prevent the precursor lesion Barrett’s oesophagus. Furthermore, there is an improved understanding of genetic and environmental interactions necessary for the clonal expansion and propagation of metaplastic premalignant lesions. Clearly, three mechanisms promote cancer progression—inheritance of germ-line mutations or polymorphisms, sporadic mutagenesis, and local epigenetic alterations. Locally produced cytokines and bile acids in the refluxate create a microenvironment that sets the scene for metaplastic transformation of the oesophageal epithelium, mainly by directly affecting metaplastic stem cells.},

abstract = {Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) was recently discovered to be synthesized in mammalian tissues by several different enzymes. Numerous studies have shown that H(2)S has vasodilator and antihypertensive effects in the cardiovascular system. However, intracellular mechanisms of the H(2)S-induced vasodilation and its interactions with other endothelium-derived relaxing factors, such as nitric oxide (NO), remain unclear. We investigated whether H(2)S directly regulates endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity and NO production in endothelial cells. NaHS, a H(2)S donor, dose-dependently increased NO production in cultured endothelial cells. This effect was abolished by a calcium chelator (BAPTA-AM), but not by the absence of extracellular calcium. The NaHS-induced NO production was partially blocked by inhibitors of ryanodine receptor (dantrolene) or inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (xestospongin C). NaHS significantly increased intracellular calcium concentrations, and this effect was attenuated by dantrolene or xestospongin C. NaHS induced phosphorylation of eNOS at the activating phosphoserine residue 1179. The NaHS-induced eNOS phosphorylation and NO production were not affected by a PI3K/Akt inhibitor (wortmannin). The data of this study suggest that H(2)S directly acts on endothelial cells to induce eNOS activation and NO production by releasing calcium from the intracellular store in endoplasmic reticulum, which may explain one of mechanisms of its vasodilator function.},

abstract = {The effect of adhesion on nanoscale indentation experiments makes the interpretation of force-displacement curves acquired in these experiments very difficult. The indentation force results from the addition of adhesive and elastic forces at the indenter-sample contact. The evolution of the two forces during the indentation is determined by the variation of the indenter-sample contact radius. In the present work the variation of contact radius during atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation of elastic and adhesive samples with conical indenters (AFM tips) is indirectly determined by measurements of the contact dynamic stiffness. For weak sample deformations, the contact radius is determined mainly by the adhesion force and indenter apex radius. For strong sample deformations, the contact radius increases linearly with the increase of the indenter displacement, the slope of this linear dependence being in agreement with Sneddon's theory of indentation (Sneddon 1965 Int. J. Eng. Sci. 3 47). Based on these results, a theoretical expression of indentation force dependence on displacement is found. This expression allows for determination of the thermodynamic work of adhesion at the indenter-sample interface and the sample elasticity modulus.},

It has been suggested that such rafts could play an important role in many cellular pro- cesses including signal transduction, membrane traf- ficking, cytoskeletal organization, and pathogen entry. However, rafts have proven difficult to visualize in liv- ing cells. Most of the evidence for their existence and function relies on indirect methods such as detergent extraction, and a number of recent studies have re- vealed possible problems with these methods. Direct studies of the distribution of raft components in living cells have not yet reached a consensus on the size or even the presence of these microdomains, and hence it seems that a definitive proof of raft existence has yet to be obtained.},

abstract = {Cells face not only a complex biochemical environment but also a diverse biomechanical environment. How cells respond to variations in mechanical forces is critical in homeostasis and many diseases. The mechanisms by which mechanical forces lead to eventual biochemical and molecular responses remain undefined, and unraveling this mystery will undoubtedly provide new insight into strengthening bone, growing cartilage, improving cardiac contractility, and constructing tissues for artificial organs. In this article we review the physical bases underlying the mechanotransduction process, techniques used to apply controlled mechanical stresses on living cells and tissues to probe mechanotransduction, and some of the important lessons that we are learning from mechanical stimulation of cells with precisely controlled forces.},

@article{Weyn1998,
abstract = {The influence of fixation, air-drying and liquid-imaging on the morphology as well as on the viscoelasticity of malignant mesothelioma cells was studied by atomic force microscopy. In this study, dehydrated cells were more easily scanned and offered faster data recording than hydrated cells. However, the influence of fixation strength was more noticeable. Strong fixation induced flattening of the cytoplasm and loss of nuclear structure, resulting in a clearly visible cytoskeleton which could be easily seen as fibres orientated in the direction of the cell growth. By contrast, the morphology of hydrated cells was influenced to a lesser degree on fixation and showed an overall 'rounding' of the surface with vague, ill-defined structures. Nuclear areas of these samples were difficult to image. Viscoelasticity measurements also exhibited large differences. Dehydrated cells were much harder and showed a uniform indentation profile over the whole cell that was independent of fixation. Indentation on hydrated cells was large and depended on the height of the measuring spot, the submembranous structure and, to a lesser extent, on fixation. To calculate an overall 'cellular' viscoelasticity, different methods were tested on these samples. Indentations of multiple, randomly chosen points, covering the whole cell, were measured and averaged to yield a mean indentation score. We avoided the thin and shadowed areas since it was shown that these regions were less suited for measuring. Using this design, large viscoelasticity differences were found, on which the influence of the external parameters could be shown. In another set-up, layered imaging was tried. However, long data acquisition times caused cellular activation and rearrangement, making this scanning mode unsatisfactory.},

In this paper, gelatin coated mica surfaces are shown to be suitable for immobilizing and imaging both gram positive, Staphylococcus aureus, and gram negative, Escherichia coli, bacteria in both air and liquid environments. Gelatin coated surfaces are shown to be superior to poly-L-lysine coated surfaces that are commonly used for the immobilization of cells. This cell immobilization technique is being developed primarily for live cell imaging of Rhodopseudomonas palustris. The genome of R. palustris has been sequenced and the organism is the target of intensive studies aimed at understanding genome function. Images of R. palustris grown both aerobically and anaerobically in liquid media are presented. Images in liquid media show the bacteria is rod shaped and smooth while images in air show marked irregularity and folding of the surface. Significant differences in the vertical dimension are also apparent with the height of the bacteria in liquid being substantially greater than images taken in air. In air immobilized bacterial flagella are clearly seen while in liquid this structure is not visible. Additionally, significant morphological differences are observed that depend on the method of bacterial growth.},

abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the regulation of many physiological processes. However, overproduction of ROS under various cellular stresses results in cell death and organ injury and thus contributes to a broad spectrum of diseases and pathological conditions. The existence of different cellular sources for ROS and the distinct properties of individual ROS (their reactivity, lifetime, etc.) require adequate detection methods. We therefore compared different models of cellular stress and various ROS-sensitive dyes-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA), MitoSOX™, and MitoTracker® red CM-H(2)XRos-using a confocal fluorescent imaging approach, which has the advantage of not only detecting but also of localizing intracellular sources for ROS. Confocal acquisition of DCF-DA fluorescence can be combined with ROS detection by the mitochondria-specific probes MitoSOX™ and MitoTracker® red CM-H(2)XRos. Specificity was controlled using various antioxidants such as Trolox and N-acetylcysteine. Using different fluorescent ROS-sensitive probes, we detected higher ROS production equally under cell starvation (IL-3 or serum depletion), hypoxia-reoxygenation, or treatment of cells with prooxidants. The detected increase in ROS was approximately threefold in IL-3-depleted 32D cells, approximately 3.5-fold in serum-deprived NIH cells, and 2.5-fold to threefold in hypoxic HL-1 cells, and these findings agree well with previously published spectrofluorometric measurements. In some cases, electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was used for the validation of results from confocal fluorescent imaging. Our data show that confocal fluorescent imaging and ESR data are in good agreement. Under cellular stress, mitochondrial ROS are released into the cytoplasm and may participate in many processes, but they do not escape from the cell.},

abstract = {Inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I by rotenone had been found to induce cell death in a variety of cells. However, the mechanism is still elusive. Because reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in apoptosis and inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I by rotenone was thought to be able to elevate mitochondrial ROS production, we investigated the relationship between rotenone-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Rotenone was able to induce mitochondrial complex I substrate-supported mitochondrial ROS production both in isolated mitochondria from HL-60 cells as well as in cultured cells. Rotenone-induced apoptosis was confirmed by DNA fragmentation, cytochrome c release, and caspase 3 activity. A quantitative correlation between rotenone-induced apoptosis and rotenone-induced mitochondrial ROS production was identified. Rotenone-induced apoptosis was inhibited by treatment with antioxidants (glutathione, N-acetylcysteine, and vitamin C). The role of rotenone-induced mitochondrial ROS in apoptosis was also confirmed by the finding that HT1080 cells overexpressing magnesium superoxide dismutase were more resistant to rotenone-induced apoptosis than control cells. These results suggest that rotenone is able to induce apoptosis via enhancing the amount of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production.},

abstract = {Oxygen toxicity is the most severe side effect of oxygen therapy in neonates and adults. Pulmonary damage of oxygen toxicity is related to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the present study, we investigated the effect of hyperoxia on the production of peroxynitrite in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) and mouse lungs. Incubation of PAEC under hyperoxia (95\% O(2)) for 24 h resulted in an increase in peroxynitrite formation. Uric acid, a peroxynitrite scavenger, prevented hyperoxia-induced increase in peroxynitrite. The increase in peroxynitrite formation is accompanied by increases in nitric oxide (NO) release and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity. We have previously reported that association of eNOS with $\beta$-actin increases eNOS activity and NO production in lung endothelial cells. To study whether eNOS-$\beta$-actin association contributes to increased peroxynitrite production, eNOS-$\beta$-actin interaction were inhibited by reducing $\beta$-actin availability or by using a synthetic peptide (P326TAT) containing a sequence corresponding to the actin binding site on eNOS. We found that disruption of eNOS-$\beta$-actin interaction prevented hyperoxia-induced increases in eNOS-$\beta$-actin association, eNOS activity, NO and peroxynitrite production, and protein tyrosine nitration. Hyperoxia failed to induce the increases in eNOS activity, NO and peroxynitrite formation in COS-7 cells transfected with plasmids containing eNOS mutant cDNA in which amino acids leucine and tryptophan were replaced with alanine in the actin binding site on eNOS. Exposure of mice to hyperoxia resulted in significant increases in eNOS-$\beta$-actin association, eNOS activity, and protein tyrosine nitration in the lungs. Our data indicate that increased association of eNOS with $\beta$-actin in PAEC contributes to hyperoxia-induced increase in the production of peroxynitrite which may cause nitrosative stress in pulmonary vasculature.},

abstract = {We used a novel uniaxial stretching rheometer to measure the creep function J(t) of an isolated living cell. We show, for the first time at the scale of the whole cell, that J(t) behaves as a power-law J(t) = At(alpha). For N = 43 mice myoblasts (C2-7), we find alpha = 0.24 +/- 0.01 and A = (2.4 +/- 0.3) 10(-3) Pa(-1) s(-alpha). Using Laplace Transforms, we compare A and alpha to the parameters G(0) and beta of the complex modulus G*(omega) = G(0)omega(beta) measured by other authors using magnetic twisting cytometry and atomic force microscopy. Excellent agreement between A and G(0) on the one hand, and between alpha and beta on the other hand, indicated that the power-law is an intrinsic feature of cell mechanics and not the signature of a particular technique. Moreover, the agreement between measurements at very different size scales, going from a few tens of nanometers to the scale of the whole cell, suggests that self-similarity could be a central feature of cell mechanical structure. Finally, we show that the power-law behavior could explain previous results first interpreted as instantaneous elasticity. Thus, we think that the living cell must definitely be thought of as a material with a large and continuous distribution of relaxation time constants which cannot be described by models with a finite number of springs and dash-pots.},

abstract = {Vascular endothelial cells are located at the innermost layer of the blood vessel wall and are always exposed to three different mechanical forces: shear stress due to blood flow, hydrostatic pressure due to blood pressure and cyclic stretch due to vessel deformation. It is well known that endothelial cells respond to these mechanical forces and change their shapes, cytoskeletal structures and functions. In this review, we would like to mainly focus on the effects of shear stress and hydrostatic pressure on endothelial cell morphology. After applying fluid shear stress, cultured endothelial cells show marked elongation and orientation in the flow direction. In addition, thick stress fibers of actin filaments appear and align along the cell long axis. Thus, endothelial cell morphology is closely related to the cytoskeletal structure. Further, the dynamic course of the morphological changes is shown and the related events such as changes in mechanical stiffness and functions are also summarized. When endothelial cells were exposed to hydrostatic pressure, they exhibited a marked elongation and orientation in a random direction, together with development of centrally located, thick stress fibers. Pressured endothelial cells also exhibited a multilayered structure with less expression of VE-cadherin unlike under control conditions. Simultaneous loading of hydrostatic pressure and shear stress inhibited endothelial cell multilayering and induced elongation and orientation of endothelial cells with well-developed VE-cadherin in a monolayer, which suggests that for a better understanding of vascular endothelial cell responses one has to take into consideration the combination of the different mechanical forces such as exist under in vivo mechanical conditions.},

abstract = {The phosphorylation of regulatory myosin light chains by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzyme myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) has been shown to be essential and sufficient for initiation of endothelial cell retraction in saponin permeabilized monolayers (Wysolmerski, R. B. and D. Lagunoff. 1990. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 87:16-20). We now report the effects of thrombin stimulation on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVE) actin, myosin II and the functional correlate of the activated actomyosin based contractile system, isometric tension development. Using a newly designed isometric tension apparatus, we recorded quantitative changes in isometric tension from paired monolayers. Thrombin stimulation results in a rapid sustained isometric contraction that increases 2- to 2.5-fold within 5 min and remains elevated for at least 60 min. The phosphorylatable myosin light chains from HUVE were found to exist as two isoforms, differing in their molecular weights and isoelectric points. Resting isometric tension is associated with a basal phosphorylation of 0.54 mol PO4/mol myosin light chain. After thrombin treatment, phosphorylation rapidly increases to 1.61 mol PO4/mol myosin light chain within 60 s and remains elevated for the duration of the experiment. Myosin light chain phosphorylation precedes the development of isometric tension and maximal phosphorylation is maintained during the sustained phase of isometric contraction. Tryptic phosphopeptide maps from both control and thrombin-stimulated cultures resolve both monophosphorylated Ser-19 and diphosphorylated Ser-19/Thr-18 peptides indicative of MLCK activation. Changes in the polymerization of actin and association of myosin II correlate temporally with the phosphorylation of myosin II and development of isometric tension. Activation results in a 57\% increase in F-actin content within 90 s and 90\% of the soluble myosin II associates with the reorganizing F-actin. Furthermore, the disposition of actin and myosin II undergoes striking reorganization. F-actin initially forms a fine network of filaments that fills the cytoplasm and then reorganizes into prominent stress fibers. Myosin II rapidly forms discrete aggregates associated with the actin network and by 2.5 min assumes a distinct periodic distribution along the stress fibers.},

abstract = {TNF-$\alpha$ (tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$) is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that regulates the permeability of blood and lymphatic vessels. The plasma concentration of TNF-$\alpha$ is elevated (> 1 pg/mL) in several pathologies, including rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer, pre-eclampsia; in obese individuals; and in trauma patients. To test whether circulating TNF-$\alpha$ could induce similar alterations in different districts along the vascular system, three endothelial cell lines, namely HUVEC, HPMEC, and HCAEC, were characterized in terms of 1) mechanical properties, employing atomic force microscopy; 2) cytoskeletal organization, through fluorescence microscopy; and 3) membrane overexpression of adhesion molecules, employing ELISA and immunostaining. Upon stimulation with TNF-$\alpha$ (10 ng/mL for 20 h), for all three endothelial cells, the mechanical stiffness increased by about 50\% with a mean apparent elastic modulus of E \~{}5 ± 0.5 kPa (\~{}3.3 ± 0.35 kPa for the control cells); the density of F-actin filaments increased in the apical and median planes; and the ICAM-1 receptors were overexpressed compared with controls. Collectively, these results demonstrate that sufficiently high levels of circulating TNF-$\alpha$ have similar effects on different endothelial districts, and provide additional information for unraveling the possible correlations between circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and systemic vascular dysfunction.},

abstract = {Aldosterone has long been known to control water and electrolyte balance by acting on mineralocorticoid receptors in kidney. However, recent studies demonstrated the presence of these receptors in nonclassical locations, including the cardiovascular system. We tested the hypothesis whether endothelial cells respond to aldosterone with changes in cell volume, a measure for ion-mediated water movement across the cell membrane. By means of atomic force microscopy in fluid, we measured volume of adherent human umbilical venous endothelial cells exposed for 72 hours to 10 nmol/L aldosterone. Over this period of time, cells swell by approximately 18\%. Aldosterone-induced swelling is prevented by 100 nmol/L of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone, added to the primary endothelial cell culture. Aldosterone-treated cells dramatically shrink when 1 micromol/L of the diuretic amiloride is applied. Cells deprived of aldosterone do not respond to amiloride. Our conclusions are: (1) aldosterone leads to sustained cell swelling inhibited by administration of spironolactone or the sodium channel blocker amiloride; (2) cells respond to amiloride after aldosterone exposure; (3) renal diuretics act on endothelial cells; and (4) both amiloride and spironolactone could be useful for medical applications to prevent aldosterone-mediated endothelial dysfunction.},

abstract = {Dietary salt plays a major role in the regulation of blood pressure, and the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone controls salt homeostasis and extracellular volume. Recent observations suggest that a small increase in plasma sodium concentration may contribute to the pressor response of dietary salt. Because endothelial cells are (i) sensitive to aldosterone, (ii) in physical contact with plasma sodium, and (iii) crucial regulators of vascular tone, we tested whether acute changes in plasma sodium concentration, within the physiological range, can alter the physical properties of endothelial cells. The tip of an atomic force microscope was used as a nanosensor to measure stiffness of living endothelial cells incubated for 3 days in a culture medium containing aldosterone at a physiological concentration (0.45 nM). Endothelial cell stiffness was unaffected by acute changes in sodium concentration <135 mM but rose steeply between 135 and 145 mM. The increase in stiffness occurred within minutes. Lack of aldosterone in the culture medium or treatment with the epithelial sodium channel inhibitor amiloride prevented this response. Nitric oxide formation was found down-regulated in cells cultured in aldosterone-containing high sodium medium. The results suggest that changes in plasma sodium concentration per se may affect endothelial function and thus control vascular tone.},

abstract = {Here, we propose a new method to improve the atomic force microscopy (AFM) image resolution of soft samples, such as cells, in liquid. Attaching a colloid probe to a cantilever was seen improve the image resolution of a living cell in a physiological buffer solution, obtained by the normal tapping mode, when compared to an image obtained using a regular cantilever tip. This may be due to the averaging out of the cantilever tip swinging caused by the visco-elasticity of the cell. The resolution was best, when silica spheres with a 3.3 microm diameter were attached. Although larger spheres gave a resolution better than a bare cantilever tip, their resolution was less than that obtained for the 3.3 microm diameter silica colloid. This dependency of the image resolution on the colloid probe size may be a result of the increased macroscopic van der Waals attraction between the cell and probe, the decreased repulsive force dependence on the cantilever probe radius, and the decrease in resolution due to the increased probe size. The size of the colloid probe, which should be attached to the cantilever to give the best image resolution, would be the one that optimises the combined result of these facts.},

abstract = {As physical entities, living cells possess structural and physical properties that enable them to withstand the physiological environment as well as mechanical stimuli occurring within and outside the body. Any deviation from these properties will not only undermine the physical integrity of the cells, but also their biological functions. As such, a quantitative study in single cell mechanics needs to be conducted. In this review, we will examine some mechanical models that have been developed to characterize mechanical responses of living cells when subjected to both transient and dynamic loads. The mechanical models include the cortical shell-liquid core (or liquid drop) models which are widely applied to suspended cells; the solid model which is generally used for adherent cells; the power-law structural damping model which is more suited for studying the dynamic behavior of adherent cells; and finally, the biphasic model which has been widely used to study musculoskeletal cell mechanics. Based upon these models, future attempts can be made to develop even more detailed and accurate mechanical models of living cells once these three factors are adequately addressed: structural heterogeneity, appropriate constitutive relations for each of the distinct subcellular regions and components, and active forces acting within the cell. More realistic mechanical models of living cells can further contribute towards the study of mechanotransduction in cells.},

abstract = {We have investigated the role of the small guanosine-trisphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, in the early responses of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor-alpha). Quiescent confluent HUVECs incubated with TNF-alpha for 5-30 min showed an increased formation of membrane ruffles, filopodia, and actin stress fibres followed by cell retraction and formation of intercellular gaps. This process was accompanied by the dispersion of cadherin-5 from intercellular junctions. TNF-alpha also induced a transient increase in polymerized F-actin, as determined both by measuring G-actin content and by quantifying fluorescent emission from fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-phalloidin-labelled F-actin. Microinjection of cells with activated RhoA protein led to an increase in polymerized actin, formation of stress fibres, cell retraction as well as dispersion of cadherin-5. The proteins Cdc42 and Rac induced qualitatively similar effects to Rho, although not as dramatic and in addition induced formation of filopodia and lamellipodia. Microinjection of cells with a Rho inhibitor, C3 transferase, prevented gap formation caused by TNF-alpha. Similar effects were observed in cells microinjected with the dominant inhibitory proteins N17Cdc42 and N17Rac1. Cell retraction and gap formation were also prevented by inhibitors of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Our data suggest that Cdc42, Rac, and Rho are activated in a hierarchical cascade following stimulation with TNF-alpha leading to actomyosin-mediated cell retraction and formation of intercellular gaps.},

abstract = {Elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) in human blood accompanies inflammatory processes, including cardiovascular diseases. There is increasing evidence that the acute-phase reactant CRP is not only a passive marker protein for systemic inflammation but also affects the vascular system. Further, CRP is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis and the development of hypertension. Another crucial player in atherosclerotic processes is the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone. Even in low physiological concentrations, it stimulates the expression and membrane insertion of the epithelial sodium channel, thereby increasing the mechanical stiffness of endothelial cells. This contributes to the progression of endothelial dysfunction. In the present study, the hypothesis was tested that the acute application of CRP (25 mg/L), in presence of aldosterone (0.5 nmol/L; 24 hour incubation), modifies the mechanical stiffness and permeability of the endothelium. We found that endothelial cells stiffen in response to CRP. In parallel, endothelial epithelial sodium channel is inserted into the plasma membrane, while, surprisingly, the endothelial permeability decreases. CRP actions are prevented either by the inhibition of the intracellular aldosterone receptors using spironolactone (5 nmol/L) or by the inactivation of epithelial sodium channel using specific blockers. In contrast, inhibition of the release of the vasodilating gas nitric oxide via blockade of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway has no effect on the CRP-induced stiffening of endothelial cells. The data indicate that CRP enhances the effects of aldosterone on the mechanical properties of the endothelium. Thus, CRP could counteract any decrease in arterial blood pressure that accompanies severe acute inflammatory processes.},

abstract = {Mechanical stress affects and regulates many aspects of the cell, including morphology, growth, differentiation, gene expression and apoptosis. In this study we show how mechanical stress perturbs the intracellular structures of the cell and induces mechanical responses. In order to correlate mechanical perturbations to cellular responses, we used a combined fluorescence-atomic force microscope (AFM) to produce well defined nanomechanical perturbations of 10 nN while simultaneously tracking the real-time motion of fluorescently labelled mitochondria in live cells. The spatial displacement of the organelles in response to applied loads demonstrates the highly dynamic mechanical response of mitochondria in fibroblast cells. The average displacement of all mitochondrial structures analysed showed an increase of approximately 40\%, post-perturbation ( approximately 160 nm in comparison to basal displacements of approximately 110 nm). These results show that local forces can produce organelle displacements at locations far from the initial point of contact (up to approximately 40 microm). In order to examine the role of the cytoskeleton in force transmission and its effect on mitochondrial displacements, both the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton were disrupted using Cytochalasin D and Nocodazole, respectively. Our results show that there is no significant change in mitochondrial displacement following indentation after such treatments. These results demonstrate the role of the cytoskeleton in force transmission through the cell and on mitochondrial displacements. In addition, it is suggested that care must be taken when performing mechanical experiments on living cells with the AFM, as these local mechanical perturbations may have significant structural and even biochemical effects on the cell.},

abstract = {Peroxynitrite, a marker of oxidative stress, is elevated in conditions associated with vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, such as atherosclerosis, preeclampsia, and diabetes. However, the effects of peroxynitrite on endothelial cell function are not clear. The endothelium-derived enzymes nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS) mediate vascular reactivity and contain oxidant-sensitive isoforms (iNOS and PGHS-2) that can be induced by nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation. We investigated the effect(s) of peroxynitrite on NOS and PGHS pathways in endothelial cells. We hypothesized that peroxynitrite will increase levels of iNOS and PGHS-2 through activation of NF-kappaB. Western immunoblots of endothelial cells show that 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1; 0.5 mM), a peroxynitrite donor, increased iNOS protein mass, which can be inhibited by pyrroline dithiocarbamate (an NF-kappaB inhibitor) (167 +/- 24.2 vs. 78 +/- 19\%, P < 0.05, n = 6). SIN-1 treatment also significantly increased NF-kappaB translocation into endothelial cell nuclei (135 +/- 10\%, P < 0.05). Endothelial NOS, PGHS-1, and PGHS-2 protein levels were not altered by SIN-1. However, prostacyclin synthase protein mass, but not mRNA, was significantly reduced in SIN-1-treated endothelial cells (78 +/- 8.9\%, P < 0.05). Our results illustrate novel mechanisms through which peroxynitrite may modulate vascular endothelial function.},

@article{Satcher1996,
abstract = {Current modeling of endothelial cell mechanics does not account for the network of F-actin that permeates the cytoplasm. This network, the distributed cytoplasmic structural actin (DCSA), extends from apical to basal membranes, with frequent attachments. Stress fibers are intercalated within the network, with similar frequent attachments. The microscopic structure of the DCSA resembles a foam, so that the mechanical properties can be estimated with analogy to these well-studied systems. The moduli of shear and elastic deformations are estimated to be on the order of 10(5) dynes/cm2. This prediction agrees with experimental measurements of the properties of cytoplasm and endothelial cells reported elsewhere. Stress fibers can potentially increase the modulus by a factor of 2-10, depending on whether they act in series or parallel to the network in transmitting surface forces. The deformations produced by physiological flow fields are of insufficient magnitude to disrupt cell-to-cell or DCSA cross-linkages. The questions raised by this paradox, and the ramifications of implicating the previously unreported DCSA as the primary force transmission element are discussed.},

abstract = {The endothelial glycocalyx (eGC), a carbohydrate-rich layer lining the luminal side of the endothelium, regulates vascular adhesiveness and permeability. Although central to the pathophysiology of vascular barrier dysfunction in sepsis, glycocalyx damage has been generally understudied, in part because of the aberrancy of in vitro preparations and its degradation during tissue handling. The aim of this study was to analyze inflammation-induced damage of the eGC on living endothelial cells by atomic-force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation technique. AFM revealed the existence of a mature eGC on the luminal endothelial surface of freshly isolated rodent aorta preparations ex vivo, as well as on cultured human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) in vitro. AFM detected a marked reduction in glycocalyx thickness (266 ± 12 vs. 137 ± 17 nm, P<0.0001) and stiffness (0.34 ± 0.03 vs. 0.21 ± 0.01 pN/mn, P<0.0001) in septic mice (1 mg E. coli lipopolysaccharides (LPS)/kg BW i.p.) compared to controls. Corresponding in vitro experiments revealed that sepsis-associated mediators, such as thrombin, LPS or Tumor Necrosis Factor-$\alpha$ alone were sufficient to rapidly decrease eGC thickness (-50\%, all P<0.0001) and stiffness (-20\% P<0.0001) on HPMEC. In summary, AFM nanoindentation is a promising novel approach to uncover mechanisms involved in deterioration and refurbishment of the eGC in sepsis.},

@article{Notingher2007,
abstract = {One of the main challenges faced by biodetection systems is the ability to detect and identify a large range of toxins at low concentrations and in short times. Cell-based biosensors rely on detecting changes in cell behaviour, metabolism, or induction of cell death following exposure of live cells to toxic agents. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique for studying cellular biochemistry. Different toxic chemicals have different effects on living cells and induce different time-dependent biochemical changes related to cell death mechanisms. Cellular changes start with membrane receptor signalling leading to cytoplasmic shrinkage and nuclear fragmentation. The potential advantage of Raman spectroscopy cell-based systems is that they are not engineered to respond specifically to a single toxic agent but are free to react to many biologically active compounds. Raman spectroscopy biosensors can also provide additional information from the time-dependent changes of cellular biochemistry. Since no cell labelling or staining is required, the specific time dependent biochemical changes in the living cells can be used for the identification and quantification of the toxic agents. Thus, detection of biochemical changes of cells by Raman spectroscopy could overcome the limitations of other biosensor techniques, with respect to detection and discrimination of a large range of toxic agents. Further developments of this technique may also include integration of cellular microarrays for high throughput in vitro toxicological testing of pharmaceuticals and in situ monitoring of the growth of engineered tissues.},

abstract = {About one third of the population worldwide is supposed to be salt sensitive which is a major cause for arterial hypertension later in life. For preventive actions it is thus desirable to identify salt-sensitive individuals before the appearance of clinical symptoms. Recent observations suggest that the vascular endothelium consists of two salt-sensitive barriers in series, the glycocalyx that buffers sodium and the endothelial cell membrane that contains sodium channels. Glycocalyx sodium buffer capacity and sodium channel activity are conversely related to each other. For proof of concept, a so-called salt provocation test (SPT) was developed that should unmask vascular salt sensitivity in humans at virtually any age. Nineteen healthy subjects, ranging from 25 to 63 years of age, underwent two series of 1-h blood pressure measurements after acute ingestion of a salt cocktail with or without addition of a sodium channel blocker effective in vascular endothelium. Differential analysis of the changes in diastolic blood pressure (net ∆DP) identified 12 individuals (63\%) as being salt resistant (net ∆DP = -0.05 ± 0.62 mmHg) and seven individuals (37\%) as being salt sensitive (net ∆DP = +6.98 ± 0.75 mmHg). Vascular salt sensitivity was not related to the age of the study participants. It is concluded that the SPT could be useful for identifying vascular salt sensitivity in humans already early in life.},

abstract = {In the presence of aldosterone, plasma sodium in the high physiological range stiffens endothelial cells and reduces the release of nitric oxide. We now demonstrate effects of extracellular potassium on stiffness of individual cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells by using the tip of an atomic force microscope as a mechanical nanosensor. An acute increase of potassium in the physiological range swells and softens the endothelial cell and increases the release of nitric oxide. A high physiological sodium concentration, in the presence of aldosterone, prevents these changes. We propose that the potassium effects are caused by submembranous cortical fluidization because cortical actin depolymerization induced by cytochalasin D mimics the effect of high potassium. In contrast, a low dose of trypsin, known to activate sodium influx through epithelial sodium channels, stiffens the submembranous cell cortex. Obviously, the cortical actin cytoskeleton switches from gelation to solation depending on the ambient sodium and potassium concentrations, whereas the center of the cell is not involved. Such a mechanism would control endothelial deformability and nitric oxide release, and thus influence systemic blood pressure.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mitochondrial depolarization after ATP-sensitive potassium channel activation has been shown to induce cerebral vasodilation by the generation of calcium sparks in smooth muscle. It is unclear, however, whether mitochondrial depolarization in endothelial cells is capable of promoting vasodilation by releasing vasoactive factors. Therefore, we studied the effect of endothelial mitochondrial depolarization by mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel activators, BMS-191095 (BMS) and diazoxide, on endothelium-dependent vasodilation. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Diameter studies in isolated rat cerebral arteries showed BMS- and diazoxide-induced vasodilations that were diminished by endothelial denudation. Mitochondrial depolarization-induced vasodilation was reduced by inhibition of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels, phosphoinositide-3 kinase, or nitric oxide synthase. Scavenging of reactive oxygen species, however, diminished vasodilation induced by diazoxide, but not by BMS. Fluorescence studies in cultured rat brain microvascular endothelial cells showed that BMS elicited mitochondrial depolarization and enhanced nitric oxide production; diazoxide exhibited largely similar effects, but unlike BMS, increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. Measurements of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)]i) in cultured rat brain microvascular endothelial cells and arteries showed that both diazoxide and BMS increased endothelial [Ca(2+)]i. Western blot analyses revealed increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) by BMS and diazoxide. Increased phosphorylation of eNOS by diazoxide was abolished by phosphoinositide-3 kinase inhibition. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy confirmed vascular nitric oxide generation in response to diazoxide and BMS. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological depolarization of endothelial mitochondria promotes activation of eNOS by dual pathways involving increased [Ca(2+)]i as well as by phosphoinositide-3 kinase-protein kinase B-induced eNOS phosphorylation. Both mitochondrial reactive oxygen species-dependent and -independent mechanisms mediate activation of eNOS by endothelial mitochondrial depolarization.},

abstract = {The degree of mechanical stiffness of vascular endothelial cells determines the endogenous production of the vasodilating gas nitric oxide (NO). However, the underlying mechanisms are not yet understood. Experiments on vascular endothelial cells suggest that the electrical plasma membrane potential is involved in this regulatory process. To test this hypothesis we developed a technique that simultaneously measures the electrical membrane potential and stiffness of vascular endothelial cells (GM7373 cell line derived from bovine aortic endothelium) under continuous perfusion with physiological electrolyte solution. The cellular stiffness was determined by nano-indentation using an atomic force microscope (AFM) while the electrical membrane potential was measured with bis-oxonol, a voltage-reporting fluorescent dye. These two methods were combined using an AFM attached to an epifluorescence microscope. The electrical membrane potential and mechanical stiffness of the same cell were continuously recorded for a time span of 5 min. Fast fluctuations (in the range of seconds) of both the electrical membrane potential and mechanical stiffness could be observed that were not related to each other. In contrast, slow cell depolarizations (in the range of minutes) were paralleled by significant increases in mechanical stiffness. In conclusion, using the combined AFM-fluorescence technique we monitored for the first time simultaneously the electrical plasma membrane potential and mechanical stiffness in a living cell. Vascular endothelial cells exhibit oscillatory non-synchronized waves of electrical potential and mechanical stiffness. The sustained membrane depolarization, however, is paralleled by a concomitant increase of cell stiffness. The described method is applicable for any fluorophore, which opens new perspectives in biomedical research.},

abstract = {The Poisson-Boltzmann equation is modified to consider charge ionogenicity, steric exclusion, and charge distribution in order to describe the perimembranous electrostatic potential profile in a manner consistent with the known morphology and biochemical composition of the cell's glycocalyx. Exact numerical and approximate analytical solutions are given for various charge distributions and for an extended form of the Donnan potential model. The interrelated effects of ionic conditions, bulk pH, ion binding, local dielectric, steric volume exclusion, and charge distribution on the local potential, pH, and charge density within the glycocalyx are examined. Local charge-induced, potential-mediated pH reductions cause glycocalyx charge neutralization. Under certain conditions, local potentials may be insensitive to ionic strength or may decrease in spite of increasing charge density. The volume exclusion of the glycocalyx reduces the local ion concentration, thereby increasing the local potential. With neutral lipid membranes, the Donnan and surface potential agree if the glycocalyx charge distribution is both uniform and several times thicker than the Debye length (approximately 20 A in thickness under physiological conditions). Model limitations in terms of application to microdomains or protein endo- and ectodomains are discussed.},

abstract = {We previously reported that tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) can mimic classic ischemic preconditioning (IPC) in both cells and heart. However, the signalling pathways involved remain incompletely understood. One potential protective pathway could be TNFalpha-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). We hypothesized that TNFalpha cytoprotection occurs through the generation of ROS which originate within the mitochondria. C(2)C(12) myotubes were preconditioned with either a short period of hypoxia (IPC) or a low concentration of TNFalpha (0.5 ng/ml) prior to a simulated ischemic insult. ROS generation was evaluated on cells stained with dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) by flow cytometry. The source of TNFalpha-induced ROS was examined with Mitotracker Red CM-H(2)XRos. The bioenergetics of the mitochondria were evaluated by investigation of the respiratory parameters and the inner mitochondrial membrane potential. Pretreatment with TNFalpha improved cell viability compared with the simulated ischemic control (TNFalpha: 75 +/- 1\% versus 34 +/- 1\% for the control: p<0.001). The ROS scavenger, N-2-mercaptopropionyl-glycine (MPG), reduced the viability of TNFalpha-stimulated cells to 15 +/- 1\% (p<0.001 versus TNFalpha). Similar results were obtained with IPC. TNFalpha stimulation increased ROS production mainly in the mitochondria, and this increase was abolished in the presence of MPG. Addition of TNFalpha to the cells increased State 2 respiration and modestly depolarised the membrane potential prior to the ischemic insult. In conclusion, TNFalpha-induced ROS generation can occur within the mitochondria, resulting in temporal mitochondrial perturbations which may initiate the cytoprotective effect of TNFalpha.},

abstract = {Plasma sodium, slightly above normal and in presence of aldosterone, stiffens vascular endothelium and reduces nitric oxide release with the consequence of endothelial dysfunction. This process is mediated by epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) and, most likely, the endothelial Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. Both, ENaC and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, are located in the plasma membrane of endothelial cells and embedded in the endothelial glycocalyx (eGC). This negatively charged biopolymer is directly exposed to the blood stream and selectively buffers sodium ions. We hypothesize that the glycocalyx could interfere with endothelial sodium transport when extracellular sodium varies in the physiological range. Therefore, we modeled the endothelial cell as a pump-leak system measuring changes of intracellular sodium in cultured human endothelial cells. Experiments were performed under low/high extracellular sodium conditions before and after enzymatic eGC removal, and with inhibition of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and ENaC, respectively. Three major observations were made: (1) eGC removal by heparinase treatment facilitates sodium to enter/exit the endothelial cells. (2) The direction of net sodium movement across the endothelial plasma membrane depends on the concentration of extracellular sodium which regulates both the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and ENaC activity. (3) Removal of eGC and inhibition of sodium transport modify the electrical resistance of endothelial cells. We conclude that the eGC serves as a potential "firewall" preventing uncontrolled access of sodium to the pump-leak system of the endothelial cell. After eGC removal, sodium access to the system is facilitated. Thus the pump-leak system could be regulated by ambient sodium and control vascular permeability in pathophysiological conditions.},

abstract = {Mechanical properties of living cells are important for cell shape, motility, and cellular responses to biochemical and biophysical signals. Although these properties are predominantly determined by the cytoskeleton, relatively little is known about the mechanical organization of cells at a subcellular level. We have studied the cell cortex of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAECs) using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM). We show that the contrast in AFM imaging of these cells derives in large part from differences in local mechanical properties, and AFM images of BPAEC reveal the local micromechanical architecture of their apical cortex at ;125 nm resolution. Mechanically the cortex in these cells is organized as a polygonal mesh at two length scales: a coarse mesh with mesh element areas ;0.5–10 mm2, and a finer mesh with areas ,0.5 mm2. These meshes appear to be intertwined, which may have interesting implications for the mechanical properties of the cell. Correlated AFM-CFM experiments and pharmacological treatments reveal that actin and vimentin are components of the coarse mesh, but microtubules are not mechanical components of the BPAEC apical cortex.},

abstract = {The interactions of bacteria with their environment are governed by a complex interplay between biological and physicochemical phenomena. The main challenge is the joint determination of the intertwined interfacial characteristics of bacteria such as mechanical and hydrodynamic softness, interfacial heterogeneity, and electrostatic properties. In this study, we have combined electrokinetics and force spectroscopy to unravel this intricate coupling for two types of Shewanella bacterial strains that vary according to the nature of their outer, permeable, charged gel-like layers. The theoretical interpretation of the bacterial electrokinetic response allows for the estimation of the hydrodynamic permeability, degree of interfacial heterogeneity, and volume charge density for the soft layer that constitutes the outer permeable part of the bacteria. Additionally, the electrostatic interaction forces between an AFM probe and the bacteria were calculated on the basis of their interfacial properties obtained from advanced soft particle electrokinetic analysis. For both bacterial strains, excellent agreement between experimental and theoretical force curves is obtained, which highlights the necessity to account for the interfacial heterogeneity of the bioparticle to interpret AFM and electrokinetic data consistently. From the force profiles, we also derived the relevant mechanical parameters in relation to the turgor pressure within the cell and the nature of the bacterial outer surface layer. These results corroborate the heterogeneous representation of the bacterial interface and show that the decrease in the turgor pressure of the cell with increasing ionic strength is more pronounced for bacteria with a thin surface gel-like layer.},

According to a major role of COX-2 as a source of prostacyclin production even in unstimulated endothelial cells, prostacyclin production was concentration-dependently inhibited by the selective COX-2 inhibitor SC236. Overall, our results suggest a possible link between reduced endothelial COX-2 and NO-synthase expression and the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases affecting diabetic patients, and point to the use of endothelial cells from diabetic patients as a tool for investigating early dysfunction in pathological endothelium.},

abstract = {The atomic force microscope (AFM) has found wide applicability as a nanoindentation tool to measure local elastic properties of soft materials. An automated approach to the processing of AFM indentation data, namely, the extraction of Young's modulus, is essential to realizing the high-throughput potential of the instrument as an elasticity probe for typical soft materials that exhibit inhomogeneity at microscopic scales. This paper focuses on Hertzian analysis techniques, which are applicable to linear elastic indentation. We compiled a series of synergistic strategies into an algorithm that overcomes many of the complications that have previously impeded efforts to automate the fitting of contact mechanics models to indentation data. AFM raster data sets containing up to 1024 individual force-displacement curves and macroscopic compression data were obtained from testing polyvinyl alcohol gels of known composition. Local elastic properties of tissue-engineered cartilage were also measured by the AFM. All AFM data sets were processed using customized software based on the algorithm, and the extracted values of Young's modulus were compared to those obtained by macroscopic testing. Accuracy of the technique was verified by the good agreement between values of Young's modulus obtained by AFM and by direct compression of the synthetic gels. Validation of robustness was achieved by successfully fitting the vastly different types of force curves generated from the indentation of tissue-engineered cartilage. For AFM indentation data that are amenable to Hertzian analysis, the method presented here minimizes subjectivity in preprocessing and allows for improved consistency and minimized user intervention. Automated, large-scale analysis of indentation data holds tremendous potential in bioengineering applications, such as high-resolution elasticity mapping of natural and artificial tissues.},

abstract = {Complex cellular and inflammatory interactions are involved in the progress of vascular diseases. Endothelial cells, upon exposure to cytokines, undergo profound alterations of function that involve gene expression and de novo protein synthesis. The functional reprogramming of endothelial cells by cytokines is of importance especially in patients with chronic vascular inflammation. The intercellular network of dendritic cells, T-lymphocytes, macrophages and smooth muscle cells generates a variety of stimulatory cytokines [e.g. TNF-alpha (tumour necrosis factor-alpha), IL (interleukin)-1, IL-6 and IFN-gamma (interferon-gamma)] and growth factors that promote the development of functional and structural vascular changes. High concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines increase oxidative stress, down-regulate eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) bioactivity and induce endothelial cell apoptosis. Chemoattractant cytokines [e.g. VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor-beta1) and IL-8] are important regulators of inflammation-induced angiogenesis and are directly modulated by nitric oxide. This review will focus on the vascular mechanisms orchestrated by cytokines and summarizes the current knowledge concerning the contribution of cytokines to cardiovascular diseases.},

@article{Fels2010,
abstract = {In the vascular endothelium, mechanical cell stiffness (К) and nitric oxide (NO) release are tightly coupled. "Soft" cells release more NO compared to "stiff" cells. Currently, however, it is not known whether NO itself is the primary factor that softens the cells or whether NO release is the result of cell softening. To address this question, a hybrid fluorescence/atomic force microscope was used in order to measure changes in К and NO release simultaneously in living vascular endothelial cells. Aldosterone was applied to soften the cells transiently and to trigger NO release. NO synthesis was then either blocked or stimulated and, simultaneously, К was measured. Cell indentation experiments were performed to evaluate К, while NO release was measured either by an intracellular NO-dependent fluorescence indicator (DAF-FM/DA) or by NO-selective electrodes located close to the cell surface. After the application of aldosterone, К decreases, within 10 min, to 80.5 ± 1.7\% of control (100\%). DAF-FM fluorescence intensity increases simultaneously to 132.9 ± 2.2\%, which indicates a significant increase in the activity of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Inhibition of eNOS (by N ($\omega$)-nitro-L: -arginine methyl ester) blocks the NO release, but does not affect the aldosterone-induced changes in К. Application of an eNOS-independent NO donor (NONOate/AM) raises intracellular NO concentration, but, again, does not affect К. Data analysis indicates that a decrease of К by about 10\% is sufficient to induce a significant increase of eNOS activity. In conclusion, these nanomechanic properties of endothelial cells in vascular endothelium determine NO release, and not vice versa.},

abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a promising microscopy technique that can provide high-resolution images of bacterial cells without fixation. Three species of bacteria, Xanthomonas campestris, Pseudomonas syringae, and Bacillus subtilis, were used in this study. AFM images were obtained from unfixed and glutaraldehyde-fixed cells, and cell height was measured. The mean height of bacterial cells prepared by fixation was higher than that of those prepared by nonfixation. However, the height changes were different between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria: the mean height of two fixed Gram-negative bacteria, X. campestris and P. syringae, increased by 112.31 and 84.08\%, respectively, whereas Gram-positive bacterium, B. subtilis, increased only by 38.79\%. The results above indicated that glutaraldehyde fixation could affect the measured height of cells imaged by AFM; further more, the effect of glutaraldehyde fixation on the measured height of Gram-negative bacterial cells imaged by AFM seemed much more than on that of Gram-positive bacterial cells.},

abstract = {We measured the gene expression, glycocalyx content, and surface properties of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) cultured on poly(sodium p-styrene sulfonate) (PNaSS) hydrogels with various levels of elasticity ranged in 3-300 kPa. We found that all HCAECs reached confluence on these hydrogels while retaining the similar expression of EC-specific markers to that on polystyrene (PS), a widely used scaffold in cell culture in vitro. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) assay showed that the amount of EC-specific glycocalyx secreted by HCAECs cultured on PNaSS gels was higher than that cultured on PS, and it increased with an increase of gel elasticity. Furthermore, the HCAECs cultured on PNaSS gels showed excellent property against platelet adhesion and lower surface friction than that on PS. The platelet adhesion and surface friction of HCAECs cultured on PNaSS gels also depend on the elasticity of gels. The largest amount of EC-specific glycocalyx, excellent blood compatibility, and the lowest friction were observed when the elastic modulus of the gel was larger than 60 kPa. Overall, HCAECs cultured on these hydrogels have better properties than those cultured on PS scaffold, demonstrating the PNaSS gels can be used as potential tissue engineering material for blood vessels.},

Efforts to combine SPM with optical spectroscopy will be described, and the technical difficulties encountered will be examined. These efforts have so far focused mainly on the development of tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, a powerful technique to detect and image chemical signatures with single molecule sensitivity, which will be reviewed. Beyond tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and/or topography measurements, combinations of SPM with optical spectroscopy have a great potential in the characterization of structure and quantitative measurements of physical properties, such as mechanical, optical, or electrical properties, in delicate biological samples and nanomaterials. The different approaches to improve the spatial resolution, the chemical sensitivity, and the accuracy of physical properties measurements will be discussed. Applications of such combinations for the characterization of structure, defects, and physical properties in biology and materials science will be reviewed. Due to the versatility of SPM probes for the manipulation and characterization of small and/or delicate samples, this review will mainly focus on the apertureless techniques based on SPM probes.},

@article{Unterberger2013,
abstract = {Filamentous actin is one of the main constituents of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. The actin cortex, a densely cross-linked network, resides underneath the lipid bilayer. In the present work we propose a continuum mechanical formulation for describing the viscoelastic properties of in vitro actin networks, which serve as model systems for the cortex, by including the microstructure, i.e. the behavior of a single filament and its spatial arrangement. The modeling of the viscoelastic response in terms of physically interpretable parameters is conducted using a multiscale approach consisting of two steps: modeling of the single filament response of F-actin by a worm-like chain model including the extensibility of the filament, and assembling the three-dimensional biopolymer network by using the microsphere model which accounts for filaments equally distributed in space. The viscoelastic effects of the network are taken into account using a generalized Maxwell model. The Cauchy stress and elasticity tensors are obtained within a continuum mechanics framework and implemented into a finite-element program. The model is validated on the network level using large strain experiments on reconstituted actin gels. Comparisons of the proposed model with rheological experiments recover reasonable values for the material parameters. Finite-element simulations of the indentation of a sphere on a network slab and the aspiration of a droplet in a micropipette allow for further insights of the viscoelastic behavior of actin networks.},

abstract = {We present an investigation of the optical excitation of surface plasmons on Au films deposited on roughened surfaces by using a glancing angle deposition technique. By adjusting the deposition parameters of calcium fluoride and Au thin films, the spectral position of the surface plasmon resonances can be shifted through the green and into the near infrared region. In particular, we find that a rougher surface with obliquely deposited Au produces distinct spheroid-shaped nanoparticles (NPs). This results in stronger resonances with narrower linewidths, whereas smoother films result in broad red-shifted absorption. Imaging with an atomic force microscope and a scanning electron microscope provides information of NP geometry which are used as inputs for theoretical simulations of the observed spectra. The consequence of geometry distributions and inter-particle interactions are discussed. The ability to control the shape, therefore the optical response, of Au NPs over an arbitrarily large active area is of paramount importance in nano-science, especially in biological sensing applications and surface enhanced Raman scattering.},

Upon adhesion of the leukocyte to endothelial ICAM-1, ICAM-1 is clustered and recruited to the adhered leukocyte, promoting strong adhesion. In this study, we provide evidence for the colocalization of VCAM-1 at sites of ICAM-1 clustering. Anti-ICAM-1 antibody-coated beads were used to selectively cluster and recruit ICAM-1 on primary human endothelial cells. In time, co-localization of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 around the adherent beads was observed. Biochemical pull-down assays showed that ICAM-1 clustering induced its association to VCAM-1, suggesting a physical link between these two adhesion molecules. The association was partly dependent on lipid rafts as well as on F-actin and promoted adhesion. These data show that VCAM-1 can be recruited, in an integrin-independent fashion, to clustered ICAM-1 which may serve to promote ICAM-1-mediated leukocyte adhesion.},

abstract = {Cytoskeletal structure is continually remodeled to accommodate normal cell growth and to respond to pathophysiological cues. As a consequence, several cytoskeleton-interacting proteins become involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cell growth and division, cell movement, vesicle transportation, cellular organelle location and function, localization and distribution of membrane receptors, and cell-cell communication. Molecular chaperones and immunophilins are counted among the most important proteins that interact closely with the cytoskeleton network, in particular with microtubules and microtubule-associated factors. In several situations, heat-shock proteins and immunophilins work together as a functionally active heterocomplex, although both types of proteins also show independent actions. In circumstances where homeostasis is affected by environmental stresses or due to genetic alterations, chaperone proteins help to stabilize the system. Molecular chaperones facilitate the assembly, disassembly and/or folding/refolding of cytoskeletal proteins, so they prevent aberrant protein aggregation. Nonetheless, the roles of heat-shock proteins and immunophilins are not only limited to solve abnormal situations, but they also have an active participation during the normal differentiation process of the cell and are key factors for many structural and functional rearrangements during this course of action. Cytoskeleton modifications leading to altered localization of nuclear factors may result in loss- or gain-of-function of such factors, which affects the cell cycle and cell development. Therefore, cytoskeletal components are attractive therapeutic targets, particularly microtubules, to prevent pathological situations such as rapidly dividing tumor cells or to favor the process of cell differentiation in other cases. In this review we will address some classical and novel aspects of key regulatory functions of heat-shock proteins and immunophilins as housekeeping factors of the cytoskeletal network.},

@article{Rostgaard1997,
abstract = {The permeability of capillaries is usually explained with reference to "small pores," permeable to water and small solutes, and "large pores," permeable to proteins. Fenestrated capillaries are far more permeable to water and small solutes than nonfenestrated capillaries; moreover, the permeability is highest in the capillaries with the most fenestrae. This suggests that the small pores reside in the fenestral diaphragms; however, no such pores have been illustrated using electron microscopy. In an attempt to clarify this controversy, fenestrated capillaries in the small intestine, stomach, and kidney of the rat were reinvestigated by electron microscopy. A new method of vascular perfusion-fixation was employed, which included the use of glutaraldehyde dissolved in an oxygen-carrying blood substitute (fluorocarbon) and delivered by a peristaltic pump controlled by pressure feedback. The investigation disclosed a prominent endocapillary surface coat, about 50-100 nm thick, and the existence of bush-like filamentous sieve plugs in the fenestrae. Each filamentous plug was composed of 20-40 filaments, each filament measuring 300-400 nm in length and 5-10 nm in thickness. The filamentous plugs have tentatively been named fascinae fenestrae, because they resemble fascines and may also function as such.},

abstract = {Early detection of (pre-)cancerous changes improves prognosis, therefore in the UK patients at high risk of developing gastrointestinal cancers are enrolled on endoscopic surveillance programmes or the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme. The current gold standard technique for the detection of pre-cancerous changes in the gastrointestinal tract is histopathological analysis of biopsy tissue collected at endoscopy. This relies upon subjective assessment of morphological changes within the excised tissue samples and poor targeting of pre-malignant lesions. Raman spectroscopy offers a number of potential advantages for in vivo assessment of tissue at endoscopy. The performance of a custom built Raman probe as a biopsy targeting tool has been evaluated using excised biopsy material. Multivariate classification models have been used to demonstrate the likely ability of a miniature, confocal, fibre optic Raman probe to be used as an optical biopsy tool at endoscopy to provide spectral information in clinically practicable timescales. This technique could facilitate improved targeting of excisional biopsy with associated clinical benefits.},

In this operating mode, the deformation of the cantilever is displayed as a function of the indentation depth of the tip into the sample. Fitting this curve with different theoretical models permits us to estimate the Young's modulus of the sample at the indentation spot. We describe what to our knowledge is a new technique to process these curves to distinguish structures of different stiffness buried into the bulk of the sample.

abstract = {Uniaxial stretch is an important biophysical regulator of cell morphology (or shape) and functions of vascular endothelial cells (ECs). However, it is unclear whether and how cell shape can independently regulate EC mechanotransductive properties under uniaxial stretch. Herein, utilizing a novel uniaxial cell-stretching device integrated with micropost force sensors, we reported the first experimental evidence showing cell shape-dependent EC mechanotransduction via cytoskeleton (CSK) contractile forces in response to uniaxial stretch. Combining experiments and theoretical modeling from first principles, we showed that it was the global architecture of the F-actin CSK that instructed the cell shape-dependent EC mechanotransductive process. Furthermore, a cell shape-dependent nature was relayed in EC mechanotransduction via dynamic focal adhesion (FA) assembly. Our results suggested a novel mechanotransductive process in ECs wherein the global architecture of the F-actin CSK, governed by cell shape, controls mechanotransduction via CSK contractile forces and force-dependent FA assembly under uniaxial stretch.},

abstract = {Inflammation is a complex and potentially life-threatening condition that involves the participation of a variety of chemical mediators, signaling pathways, and cell types. The microcirculation, which is critical for the initiation and perpetuation of an inflammatory response, exhibits several characteristic functional and structural changes in response to inflammation. These include vasomotor dysfunction (impaired vessel dilation and constriction), the adhesion and transendothelial migration of leukocytes, endothelial barrier dysfunction (increased vascular permeability), blood vessel proliferation (angiogenesis), and enhanced thrombus formation. These diverse responses of the microvasculature largely reflect the endothelial cell dysfunction that accompanies inflammation and the central role of these cells in modulating processes as varied as blood flow regulation, angiogenesis, and thrombogenesis. The importance of endothelial cells in inflammation-induced vascular dysfunction is also predicated on the ability of these cells to produce and respond to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Inflammation seems to upset the balance between nitric oxide and superoxide within (and surrounding) endothelial cells, which is necessary for normal vessel function. This review is focused on defining the molecular targets in the vessel wall that interact with reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide to produce the characteristic functional and structural changes that occur in response to inflammation. This analysis of the literature is consistent with the view that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species contribute significantly to the diverse vascular responses in inflammation and supports efforts that are directed at targeting these highly reactive species to maintain normal vascular health in pathological conditions that are associated with acute or chronic inflammation.},

The eNOS enzyme reversibly associates with a diverse family of protein partners that regulate eNOS sub-cellular localization, catalytic function, and biological activity. eNOS enzyme activity and sub-cellular localization are intimately controlled by post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, nitrosylation, and acylation. The multiple extra-cellular stimuli affecting eNOS function coordinate their efforts through these key modifications to dynamically control eNOS and NO bioactivity in the vessel wall. This review will focus on the biochemical partners and perturbations of the eNOS protein as this vital enzyme undergoes modulation by diverse signal transduction pathways in the vascular endothelium.},

abstract = {Calmodulin (CaM) and Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) play important roles in the development of heart failure. In this study, we evaluated the effects of CaM on mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), permeability transition pore (mPTP) and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in permeabilized myocytes; our findings are as follows. (1) CaM depolarized DeltaPsi(m) dose-dependently, but this was prevented by an inhibitor of CaM (W-7) or CaMKII (autocamtide 2-related inhibitory peptide (AIP)). (2) CaM accelerated calcein leakage from mitochondria, indicating the opening of mPTP, however this was prevented by AIP. (3) Cyclosporin A (an inhibitor of the mPTP) inhibited both CaM-induced DeltaPsi(m) depolarization and calcein leakage. (4) CaM increased mitochondrial ROS, which was related to DeltaPsi(m) depolarization and the opening of mPTP. (5) Chelating of cytosolic Ca(2+) by BAPTA, the depletion of SR Ca(2+) by thapsigargin (an inhibitor of SERCA) and the inhibition of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter by Ru360 attenuated the effects of CaM on mitochondrial function. (6) CaM accelerated Ca(2+) extrusion from mitochondria. We conclude that CaM/CaMKII depolarized DeltaPsi(m) and opened mPTP by increasing ROS production, and these effects were strictly regulated by the local increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration, initiated by Ca(2+) releases from the SR. In addition, CaM was involved in the regulation of mitochondrial Ca(2+) homeostasis.},

Understanding the molecular and biophysical mechanisms of their activation is an important research pursuit. It is controversial whether eukaryotic MS channels need accessory proteins -- typically cytoskeletal structures -- for activation, because MS channel activities are modulated by pharmacological treatments that affect the cytoskeleton. Here we demonstrate that direct mechanical stimulation (stretching) of an actin stress fiber using optical tweezers can activate MS channels in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, by using high-speed total internal reflection microscopy, we visualized spots of Ca(2+) influx across individual MS channels distributed near focal adhesions in the basal surface of HUVECs. This study provides the first direct evidence that the cytoskeleton works as a force-transmitting and force-focusing molecular device to activate MS channels in eukaryotic cells.},

abstract = {There is accumulating evidence that mineralocorticoids not only act on kidney but also on the cardiovascular system. We investigated the response of human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs) to aldosterone at a time scale of 20 minutes in absence and presence of the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone or other transport inhibitors. We applied atomic force microscopy (AFM), which measures cell volume and volume shifts between cytosol and cell nucleus. We observed an immediate cell volume increase (about 10\%) approximately 1 min after addition of aldosterone (0.1 micromol/l), approaching a maximum (about 18\%) 10 min after aldosterone treatment. Cell volume returned to normal 20 min after hormone exposure. Spironolactone (1 micromol/l) or amiloride (1 micromol/l) prevented the late aldosterone-induced volume changes but not the immediate change observed 1 min after hormone exposure. AFM revealed nuclear swelling 5 min after aldosterone addition, followed by nuclear shrinkage 15 min later. The Na(+)/H(+) exchange blocker cariporide (10 micromol/l) was ineffective. We conclude: (i). Aldosterone induces immediate (1 min) swelling independently of plasma membrane Na(+) channels and intracellular mineralocorticoid receptors followed by late mineralocorticoid receptor- and Na(+)-channel-dependent swelling. (ii). Intracellular macromolecule shifts cause the changes in cell volume. (iii). Both amiloride and spironolactone may be useful for medical applications to prevent aldosterone-induced vasculopathies.},

In this study, we report on the fabrication of SERS-active substrates through the convective assembly of gold (Au) particles on electrostatically charged glass slides. We show that, by a proper control of the initial particle concentration in an evaporating Au suspension droplet, it is possible to obtain a closely packed colloidal film capable of generating SERS activity. Finally, AFM and SERS measurements of the resulting films reveal comparability in performance with previous silane-immobilized Au colloidal films. The minimum electromagnetic enhancement factor of our films is estimated to be about 2 x 10(4).},

Issues concerning the progression of TERS from point spectroscopy to an imaging technique are discussed, as well as problems arising from background and contamination signals. This review is concluded with a short TERS 'user guideline', trying to aid researchers new in the field to properly align and test their own TERS setups. Finally, a short outlook is given and some critical issues are raised that need to be solved by the community sooner or later, in order to promote TERS towards a 'push-button' operation.},

abstract = {Endothelium forms a semi-permeable barrier that separates blood from the underlying tissue. Barrier function is largely determined by cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions that define the limits of cell borders. Yet, such cell-cell and cell-matrix tethering is critically reliant upon the nature of adherence within the cell itself. Indeed, the actin cytoskeleton fulfills this essential function, to provide a strong, dynamic intracellular scaffold that organizes integral membrane proteins with the cell's interior, and responds to environmental cues to orchestrate appropriate cell shape. The actin cytoskeleton is comprised of three distinct, but inter-related structures, including actin cross-linking of spectrin within the membrane skeleton, the cortical actin rim, and actomyosin-based stress fibers. This review addresses each of these actin-based structures, and discusses cellular signals that control the disposition of actin in different endothelial cell phenotypes.},

@article{Zeng2011,
abstract = {We have developed a three-dimensional random network model of the intracellular actin cytoskeleton and have used it to study the role of the cytoskeleton in mechanotransduction and nucleus deformation. We use the model to predict the deformation of the nucleus when mechanical stresses applied on the plasma membrane are propagated through the random cytoskeletal network to the nucleus membrane. We found that our results agree with previous experiments utilizing micropipette pulling. Therefore, we propose that stress propagation through the random cytoskeletal network can be a mechanism to effect nucleus deformation, without invoking any biochemical signaling activity. Using our model, we also predict how nucleus strain and its relative displacement within the cytosol vary with varying concentrations of actin filaments and actin-binding proteins. We find that nucleus strain varies in a sigmoidal manner with actin filament concentration, while there exists an optimal concentration of actin-binding proteins that maximize nucleus displacement. We provide a theoretical analysis for these nonlinearities in terms of the connectivity of the random cytoskeletal network. Finally, we discuss laser ablation experiments that can be performed to validate these results in order to advance our understanding of the role of the cytoskeleton in mechanotransduction.},

abstract = {There are distinct challenges implicit to the development of minimally invasive endoscopic surgery for the eradication of early neoplasia in Barrett's oesophagus. Endoscopic resection and ablation of high-grade dysplasia and mucosal cancer offer alternative therapeutic options to those unsuitable or unwilling to contemplate radical surgical excision. It may also become the treatment of choice in the future. Technological developments enable the instantaneous and non-invasive diagnosis of microscopic tissue abnormalities in vivo. This is made possible by improving the level of information that can be obtained from the tissue. As well as the two-dimensional surface morphology image, which the traditional endoscope can view, we have used new techniques to enable structure at depth, using Optical Coherence Tomography, to be imaged in high resolution. Other advances, using Raman spectroscopy, enable the early endoscopic detection of biochemical and molecular changes in tissue that precede any changes in morphology, thus enabling earlier diagnosis of tissue abnormalities. This King James IV lecture details our recent work, to develop advanced imaging for the diagnosis of malignancy and pre-malignancy. After detection endoscopic photodynamic therapy and endoscopic mucosal resection can provide eradication of mucosal neoplasia. Following photodynamic therapy there was complete eradication of all high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal carcinoma in 40 of 42 patients with a maximum endoscopic follow-up period of 72 months. Following endoscopic resection of 95 patients, the mean survival for intramucosal adenocarcinoma and high-grade dysplasia was 40.6 and 60.8 months respectively.},

abstract = {Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with about 6nm size were produced and stabilized with mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) film to produce a monolayer protected cluster (MPC) of AuS(CH(2))(2)COOH. 4-Aminothiophenol (ATP) molecules were introduced to the activated carboxylic acid ends of the film surrounding the AuNPs to produce AuS(CH(2))(2)CONHPhSH MPC. These modified AuNPs were again self-assembled with Au@Ag core-shell bimetallic nanoparticles via the SH groups to produce an organic bridge between Au and Au@Ag metallic nanoparticles. An unusually strong enhancement of the Raman signals was observed and assigned to the plasmon coupling between the AuNPs and Au@Ag NPs bridged assembly. Formation of AuS(CH(2))(2)COOH and AuS(CH(2))(2)CONHPhSH clusters and AuS(CH(2))(2)CONHPhS(Au@Ag) assembly is confirmed by UV-Vis, reflection-absorption IR spectroscopy (RAIRS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as well as by TEM analysis. The SERS activity of the AuNPs and Au@Ag NPs was tested using the HS(CH(2))(2)CONHPhSH molecule as a probe to compare the effectiveness of monometallic and bimetallic systems.

abstract = {Many approaches have been developed to characterize the heterogeneity of membranes in living cells. In this study, the elastic properties of specific membrane domains in living cells are characterized by atomic force microscopy. Our data reveal the existence of heterogeneous nanometric scale domains with specific biophysical properties. We focused on glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, which play an important role in membrane trafficking and cell signaling under both physiological and pathological conditions and which are known to partition preferentially into cholesterol-rich microdomains. We demonstrate that these GPI-anchored proteins reside within domains that are stiffer than the surrounding membrane. In contrast, membrane domains containing the transferrin receptor, which does not associate with cholesterol-rich regions, manifest no such feature. The heightened stiffness of GPI domains is consistent with existing data relating to the specific condensation of lipids and the slow diffusion rates of lipids and proteins therein. Our quantitative data may forge the way to unveiling the links that exist between membrane stiffness, molecular diffusion, and signaling activation.},

abstract = {Mechanical properties of single cells are of increasing interest both from a fundamental cell biological per- spective and in the context of disease diagnostics. In this respect, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has become a powerful tool for imaging and assessing mechanical properties of biological samples. However, while these tests are typically carried out on chemically fixed cells, the most important data is that on living cells. The present study applies AFM technique to assess the Young's modulus of two cell lines:mouse embryonic fibro- blasts (NIH/3T3) and human epithelial cancer cells (SW-13). Both living cells and those fixed with parafor- maldehyde were investigated. This analysis quantifies the difference between Young's modulus for these two conditions and provides a coefficient to relate them. Knowing the relation between Young's modulus of living and fixed cells, allows carrying out and comparing data obtained during steady-state measurements on fixed cells that are more frequently available in the clinical and research settings and simpler to maintain and probe. ©},

abstract = {Atomic force microscopy is being increasingly used to explore the physical properties of biological structures. This technique involves the application of a force to the sample and a monitoring of the ensuing deformation process. The available experimental setups can be broadly divided into two categories, one of which involves a stretching and the other an indentation of the organic materials. In this review, we will focus on the indentation technique and will illustrate its application to biological materials with examples that range from single molecules to living cells.},

abstract = {Knowing the dynamic mechanical response of tissue, cells, membranes, proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates to external perturbations is important to understand various biological and biotechnological problems. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based approaches are the most frequently used nanotechnologies to determine the mechanical properties of biological samples that range in size from microscopic to (sub)nanoscopic. However, the dynamic nature of biomechanical properties has barely been addressed by AFM imaging. In this work, we characterizethe viscoelastic properties of the native light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin of the purple membrane of Halobacterium salinarum. Using force-distance curve (F-D)-based AFM we imaged purple membranes while force probing their mechanical response over a wide range of loading rates (from ∼0.5 to 100 $\mu$N/s). Our results show that the mechanical stiffness of protein and membrane increases with the loading rate up to a factor of 10 (from ∼0.3 to 3.2 N/m). In addition, the electrostatic repulsion between AFM tip and sample can alter the mechanical stiffness measured by AFM up to ∼60\% (from ∼0.8 to 1.3 N/m).These findings indicate that the mechanical response of membranes and proteins and probably of other biomolecular systems should be determined at different loading rates to fully understand their properties.},

In this respect, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has become a powerful tool for imaging and assessing mechanical properties of biological samples. However, while these tests are typically carried out on chemically fixed cells, the most important data is that on living cells. The present study applies AFM technique to assess the Young's modulus of two cell lines: mouse embryonic fibroblasts (NIH/3T3) and human epithelial cancer cells (SW-13). Both living cells and those fixed with paraformaldehyde were investigated. This analysis quantifies the difference between Young's modulus for these two conditions and provides a coefficient to relate them. Knowing the relation between Young's modulus of living and fixed cells, allows carrying out and comparing data obtained during steady-state measurements on fixed cells that are more frequently available in the clinical and research settings and simpler to maintain and probe.},

@article{Qin2009,
abstract = {Intermediate filaments (IFs), in addition to microtubules and microfilaments, are one of the three major components of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells, playing a vital role in mechanotransduction and in providing mechanical stability to cells. Despite the importance of IF mechanics for cell biology and cell mechanics, the structural basis for their mechanical properties remains unknown. Specifically, our understanding of fundamental filament properties, such as the basis for their great extensibility, stiffening properties, and their exceptional mechanical resilience remains limited. This has prevented us from answering fundamental structure-function relationship questions related to the biomechanical role of intermediate filaments, which is crucial to link structure and function in the protein material's biological context. Here we utilize an atomistic-level model of the human vimentin dimer and tetramer to study their response to mechanical tensile stress, and describe a detailed analysis of the mechanical properties and associated deformation mechanisms. We observe a transition from alpha-helices to beta-sheets with subsequent interdimer sliding under mechanical deformation, which has been inferred previously from experimental results. By upscaling our results we report, for the first time, a quantitative comparison to experimental results of IF nanomechanics, showing good agreement. Through the identification of links between structures and deformation mechanisms at distinct hierarchical levels, we show that the multi-scale structure of IFs is crucial for their characteristic mechanical properties, in particular their ability to undergo severe deformation of approximately 300\% strain without breaking, facilitated by a cascaded activation of a distinct deformation mechanisms operating at different levels. This process enables IFs to combine disparate properties such as mechanosensitivity, strength and deformability. Our results enable a new paradigm in studying biological and mechanical properties of IFs from an atomistic perspective, and lay the foundation to understanding how properties of individual protein molecules can have profound effects at larger length-scales.},

@article{Schneider1997,
abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a useful technique for imaging the surface of living cells in three dimensions. The authors applied AFM to obtain morphological information of individual cultured endothelial cells of bovine aorta under stationary and strain conditions and to simultaneously measure changes in cell volume in response to aldosterone. This mineralocorticoid hormone is known to have acute, non-genomic effects on intracellular pH, intracellular electrolytes and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate production. In this study whether endothelial cells under tension change their volume in response to aldosterone was tested. Such changes were already shown in human leukocytes measured by Coulter counter. In contrast to leukocytes that are more or less spherical and live in suspension, endothelial cells exhibit a complex morphology and adhere to a substrate. Thus, measurements of discrete cell volume changes in endothelial cells under physiological condition is only feasible with more sophisticated techniques. By using AFM we could precisely measure the absolute cell volume of individual living endothelial cells. Before the addition of aldosterone the cell volume of mechanically stressed endothelial cells mimicking arterial blood pressure was 1827 +/- 172 fl. Cell volume was found to increase by 28\% 5 min after hormone exposure. Twenty-five minutes later cell volume was back to normal despite the continuous presence of aldosterone in the medium. Amiloride, a blocker of the plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger prevented the initial aldosterone-induced volume increase. Taken together, AFM disclosed a transient swelling of endothelial cells induced by the activation of an aldosterone sensitive plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger.},

The surface topography of the RBCs and the three cancer cells was mapped with a conventional AFM probe, while mechanical properties were investigated with a micro-sphere glued onto a tip-less cantilever. The diameters of RBCs are significantly smaller than those of the cancer cells, and mechanical measurements indicated that Young's modulus of RBCs is smaller than those of the cancer cells. Aggressive cancer cells have a lower Young's modulus than that of indolent cancer cells, which may improve our understanding of metastasis.},

abstract = {Complex rheology of airway smooth muscle cells and its dynamic response during contractile stimulation involves many molecular processes, foremost of which are actomyosin cross-bridge cycling and actin polymerization. With an atomic force microscope, we tracked the spatial and temporal variations of the viscoelastic properties of cultured airway smooth muscle cells. Elasticity mapping identified stiff structural elements of the cytoskeletal network. Using a precisely positioned microscale probe, picoNewton forces and nanometer level indentation modulations were applied to cell surfaces at frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 100 Hz. The resulting elastic storage modulus (G') and dissipative modulus (G'') increased dramatically, with hysteresivity (eta = G''/G') showing a definitive decrease after stimulation with the contractile agonist 5-hydroxytryptamine. Frequency-dependent assays showed weak power-law structural damping behavior and universal scaling in support of the soft-glassy material description of cellular biophysics. Additionally, a high-frequency component of the loss modulus (attributed to cellular Newtonian viscosity) increased fourfold during the contractile process. The complex shear modulus showed a strong sensitivity to the degree of actin polymerization. Inhibitors of myosin light chain kinase activity had little effect on the stiffening response to contractile stimulation. Thus, our measurements appear to be particularly well suited for characterization of dynamic actin rheology during airway smooth muscle contraction.},

@article{Maniotis1997,
abstract = {We report here that living cells and nuclei are hard-wired such that a mechanical tug on cell surface receptors can immediately change the organization of molecular assemblies in the cytoplasm and nucleus. When integrins were pulled by micromanipulating bound microbeads or micropipettes, cytoskeletal filaments reoriented, nuclei distorted, and nucleoli redistributed along the axis of the applied tension field. These effects were specific for integrins, independent of cortical membrane distortion, and were mediated by direct linkages between the cytoskeleton and nucleus. Actin microfilaments mediated force transfer to the nucleus at low strain; however, tearing of the actin gel resulted with greater distortion. In contrast, intermediate filaments effectively mediated force transfer to the nucleus under both conditions. These filament systems also acted as molecular guy wires to mechanically stiffen the nucleus and anchor it in place, whereas microtubules acted to hold open the intermediate filament lattice and to stabilize the nucleus against lateral compression. Molecular connections between integrins, cytoskeletal filaments, and nuclear scaffolds may therefore provide a discrete path for mechanical signal transfer through cells as well as a mechanism for producing integrated changes in cell and nuclear structure in response to changes in extracellular matrix adhesivity or mechanics.},

abstract = {The endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) plays a pivotal role in the physiology of the vasculature. By binding plasma proteins, the eGC forms the endothelial surface layer (ESL) which acts as an interface between bloodstream and endothelial cell surface. The functions of the eGC include mechanosensing of blood flow induced shear stress and thus flow dependent vasodilation. There are indications that levels of plasma sodium concentrations in the upper range of normal and beyond impair flow dependent regulation of blood pressure and may therefore increase the risk for hypertension. Substances, therefore, that prevent sodium induced endothelial dysfunction may be attractive for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. By means of combined atomic force-epifluorescence microscopy we studied the impact of the hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) extract WS 1442, a herbal therapeutic with unknown mechanism of action, on the mechanics of the ESL of ex vivo murine aortae. Furthermore, we measured the impact of WS 1442 on the sodium permeability of endothelial EA.hy 926 cell monolayer. The data show that (i) the ESL contributes by about 11\% to the total endothelial barrier resistance for sodium and (ii) WS 1442 strengthens the ESL resistance for sodium up to about 45\%. This mechanism may explain some of the vasoprotective actions of this herbal therapeutic.},

abstract = {In this work we present a unified method to study the mechanical properties of cells using the atomic force microscope. Stress relaxation and creep compliance measurements permitted us to determine, the relaxation times, the Young moduli and the viscosity of breast cancer cells (MCF-7). The results show that the mechanical behaviour of MCF-7 cells responds to a two-layered model of similar elasticity but differing viscosity. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with an actin-depolymerising agent results in an overall decrease in both cell elasticity and viscosity, however to a different extent for each layer. The layer that undergoes the smaller decrease (36-38\%) is assigned to the cell membrane/cortex while the layer that experiences the larger decrease (70-80\%) is attributed to the cell cytoplasm. The combination of the method presented in this work, together with the approach based on stress relaxation microscopy (Moreno-Flores et al 2010 J. Biomech. 43 349-54), constitutes a unique AFM-based experimental framework to study cell mechanics. This methodology can also be extended to study the mechanical properties of biomaterials in general.},

abstract = {A hemodynamic Lab-on-a-chip system was developed in this study. This system has two unique features: (1) it consists of a microfluidic network with an array of endothelial cell seeding sites for testing them under multiple conditions, and (2) the flow rate and the frequency of the culture medium in the microchannel are controlled by a pulsation free pump to mimic the flow profile of the blood in the blood vessel under different physiological conditions. The investigated physiological conditions were: (1) the resting condition in a normal shear stress of 15 dyne cm(-2) with a normal heart rate of 70 bpm, (2) an exhaustive exercise condition with a high shear stress of 30 dyne cm(-2) and a fast heart rate of 140 bpm, and (3) a constant high shear stress of 30 dyne cm(-2). Two chemical conditions were investigated (10 mM and 20 mM glucose) to mimic hyperglycemic conditions in diabetes patients. The effects of various shear stresses either alone or in combination with different glucose concentrations on endothelial cells were examined using the developed hemodynamic Lab-on-a-chip system by assessing two parameters. One is the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) determined by a fluorescent probe, H(2)DCFDA. Another is the mitochondrial morphology revealed with a fluorescent dye, MitoTracker Green FM. The results showed that ROS level was elevated nearly 4-fold after 60 min of exhaustive exercise. We found that the pulsatile nature of the fluid was the determination factor for causing ROS generation in the cells as almost no increase of ROS was detected in the constant shear stress condition. Similarly, much higher level of ROS was detected when 10 mM glucose was applied to the cells under normal or high pulsatile shear stresses compared with under a static condition. These results suggest that it is necessary to use pulsatile shear stress to represent the physiological conditions of the blood flow, and demonstrate the advantage of utilizing this newly developed hemodynamic Lab-on-a-chip system over the conventional non-pulsatile system in the future shear stress related studies.},

@article{Cuerrier2009,
abstract = {The endothelium is closely implicated in the control and maintenance of the vascular homeostasis. The functions of endothelial cells are highly regulated by several agonists of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), which can mediate signals involved in morphological remodeling. Here, we evaluated the mechanical properties of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in responses to two physiological agonists namely thrombin and bradykinin. We used the atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique to study changes in cell membrane stiffness and interaction between the actin cytoskeleton and the cell membrane. HUVEC stimulated with thrombin (10 nM) and bradykinin (1 microM) showed a temporal increase in their membrane stiffness from 5.0 +/- 0.1 kPa (control) to 8.2 +/- 0.4 kPa (thrombin) and 7.3 +/- 0.5 kPa (bradykinin) and in membrane tethers elongation forces from 43.9 +/- 0.9 pN (control) to 49.5 +/- 0.8 pN (thrombin) and 53.1 +/- 0.8 pN (bradykinin). These results were consistent with the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton observed in fluorescence microscopy. This study demonstrates that these agonists induce important modifications of the cell membrane properties that can be directly linked to the reorganization and the interaction of the actin cytoskeleton near the apical side of the membrane. These changes in the mechanical properties of endothelial cells provide relevant informations in the biological and pathophysiological behaviors of endothelial cells.},

@article{Polyakov2011,
abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has now become a powerful technique for investigating on a molecular level, surface forces, nanomechanical properties of deformable particles, biomolecular interactions, kinetics, and dynamic processes. This paper specifically focuses on the analysis of AFM force curves collected on biological systems, in particular, bacteria. The goal is to provide fully automated tools to achieve theoretical interpretation of force curves on the basis of adequate, available physical models. In this respect, we propose two algorithms, one for the processing of approach force curves and another for the quantitative analysis of retraction force curves. In the former, electrostatic interactions prior to contact between AFM probe and bacterium are accounted for and mechanical interactions operating after contact are described in terms of Hertz-Hooke formalism. Retraction force curves are analyzed on the basis of the Freely Jointed Chain model. For both algorithms, the quantitative reconstruction of force curves is based on the robust detection of critical points (jumps, changes of slope or changes of curvature) which mark the transitions between the various relevant interactions taking place between the AFM tip and the studied sample during approach and retraction. Once the key regions of separation distance and indentation are detected, the physical parameters describing the relevant interactions operating in these regions are extracted making use of regression procedure for fitting experiments to theory. The flexibility, accuracy and strength of the algorithms are illustrated with the processing of two force-volume images, which collect a large set of approach and retraction curves measured on a single biological surface. For each force-volume image, several maps are generated, representing the spatial distribution of the searched physical parameters as estimated for each pixel of the force-volume image.},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells the actin-cytoskeletal network provides stiffness and the driving force that contributes to changes in cell shape and cell motility, but the elastic behavior of this network is not well understood. In this paper a two dimensional form-finding model is proposed to investigate the elasticity of the actin filament network. Utilizing an initially random array of actin filaments and actin-cross-linking proteins the form-finding model iterates until the random array is brought into a stable equilibrium configuration. With some care given to actin filament density and length, distance between host sites for cross-linkers, and overall domain size the resulting configurations from the form-finding model are found to be topologically similar to cytoskeletal networks in real cells. The resulting network may then be mechanically exercised to explore how the actin filaments deform and align under load and the sensitivity of the network's stiffness to actin filament density, length, etc. Results of the model are consistent with the experimental literature, e.g. actin filaments tend to re-orient in the direction of stretching; and the filament relative density, filament length, and actin-cross-linking protein's relative density, control the actin-network stiffness. The model provides a ready means of extension to more complicated domains and a three-dimensional form-finding model is under development as well as models studying the formation of actin bundles.},

abstract = {We measured the viscoelastic properties of the cytoplasm of J774 macrophages with a recently developed microrheometer. Ferromagnetic beads (1.3 microm in diameter) were used to determine the local viscoelastic moduli. Step-force pulses were applied to the magnetic beads and the displacement was observed by single particle tracking. By analyzing the creep response curves in terms of a triphasic mechanical equivalent circuit, we measured the shear elastic modulus, the effective viscosities, and the strain relaxation time. The values of the shear modulus vary by more than an order of magnitude within the cell population (range, 20-735 Pa; average, 343 Pa) and by a factor of 2 within single cells. The effective viscosity of the cytoplasm exhibits a relatively sharp distribution about an average of eta = 210 Pa s (+/- 143 Pa s). We measured the displacement field generated by the local forces by observing the induced motion of nonmagnetic beads. Even at distances of the order of 1 microm, no induced motion was seen, suggesting that the cytoplasm is composed of clusters of densely packed and cross-linked filaments separated by soft regions. In another series of experiments we analyzed the magnetophoretic motion of the ferromagnetic beads at a constant magnetic force. Measuring the bead velocity parallel and perpendicular to the applied force showed that local active forces on the beads varied from 50 to 900 pN.},

An immobilization protocol was established where RBCs are coupled via molecular bonds of the membrane glycoproteins to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which is covalently and flexibly tethered to the support. This results in a tight but non-invasive attachment of the cells. Using tapping-mode AFM, which is known as gentle imaging mode and therefore most appropriate for soft biological samples like erythrocytes, it was possible to resolve membrane skeleton structures without major distortions or deformations of the cell surface. Significant differences in the morphology of RBCs from healthy humans and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were observed on topographical images. The surface of RBCs from SLE patients showed characteristic circular-shaped holes with approx. 200 nm in diameter under physiological conditions, a possible morphological correlate to previously published changes in the SLE erythrocyte membrane.},

@article{Basuroy2009,
abstract = {Inflammatory brain disease may damage cerebral vascular endothelium leading to cerebral blood flow dysregulation. The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha causes oxidative stress and apoptosis in cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (CMVEC) from newborn pigs. We investigated contribution of major cellular sources of reactive oxygen species to endothelial inflammatory response. Nitric oxide synthase and xanthine oxidase inhibitors (N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine and allopurinol) had no effect, while mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors (CCCP, 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone, and rotenone) attenuated TNF-alpha-induced superoxide (O(2)(*-)) and apoptosis. NADPH oxidase inhibitors (diphenylene iodonium and apocynin) greatly reduced TNF-alpha-evoked O(2)(*-) generation and apoptosis. TNF-alpha rapidly increased NADPH oxidase activity in CMVEC. Nox4, the cell-specific catalytic subunit of NADPH oxidase, is highly expressed in CMVEC, contributes to basal O(2)(*-) production, and accounts for a burst of oxidative stress in response to TNF-alpha. Nox4 small interfering RNA, but not Nox2, knockdown prevented oxidative stress and apoptosis caused by TNF-alpha in CMVEC. Nox4 is colocalized with HO-2, the constitutive isoform of heme oxygenase (HO), which is critical for endothelial protection against TNF-alpha toxicity. The products of HO activity, bilirubin and carbon monoxide (CO, as a CO-releasing molecule, CORM-A1), inhibited Nox4-generated O(2)(*-) and apoptosis caused by TNF-alpha stimulation. We conclude that Nox4 is the primary source of inflammation- and TNF-alpha-induced oxidative stress leading to apoptosis in brain endothelial cells. The ability of CO and bilirubin to combat TNF-alpha-induced oxidative stress by inhibiting Nox4 activity and/or by O(2)(*-) scavenging, taken together with close intracellular compartmentalization of HO-2 and Nox4 in cerebral vascular endothelium, may contribute to HO-2 cytoprotection against inflammatory cerebrovascular disease.},

Some features of the process, such as problem definition and construct validation, are similar to hypothesis-testing research. Others, such as within-case analysis and replication logic, are unique to the inductive, case-oriented process. Overall, the process described here is highly iterative and tightly linked to data. This research approach is especially appropriate in new topic areas. The resultant theory is often novel, testable, and empirically valid. Finally, framebreaking insights, the tests of good theory (e.g., parsimony, logical coherence), and convincing grounding in the evidence are the key criteria for evaluating this type of research.},

abstract = {The endothelial cells (ECs) lining every blood vessel wall are constantly exposed to the mechanical forces generated by blood flow. The EC responses to these hemodynamic forces play a critical role in the homeostasis of the circulatory system. To ensure proper EC mechano-sensing and transduction, there are a variety of mechano-sensors and transducers that have been identified on the EC surface, intra- and trans-EC membrane and within the EC cytoskeleton. Among them, the most recent candidate is the endothelial surface glycocalyx (ESG), which is a matrix-like thin layer covering the luminal surface of the EC. It consists of various proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans, and plasma proteins, and is close to other prominent EC mechano-sensors and transducers. The ESG thickness was found to be in the order of 0.1-1 µm by different visualization techniques and in different types of vessels. Detailed analysis on the electron microscopy (EM) images of the microvascular ESG revealed a quasi-periodic substructure with the ESG fiber diameter of 10-12 and 20 nm spacing between adjacent fibers. Atomic force microscopy and optical tweezers were applied to investigate the mechanical properties of the ESG on the cultured EC monolayers and in solutions. Enzymatic degradation of specific ESG glycosaminoglycan components was used to directly elucidate the role of the ESG in EC mechano-sensing and transduction by measuring the shear-induced productions of nitric oxide and prostacyclin, two characteristic responses of the ECs to the flow. The unique location, composition, and structure of the ESG determine its role in EC mechano-sensing and transduction.},

abstract = {The release of the main vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) by the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is a hallmark of endothelial function. We aim at elucidating the underlying mechanism how eNOS activity depends on cortical stiffness (К(cortex)) of living endothelial cells. It is hypothesized that cortical actin dynamics determines К(cortex) and directly influences eNOS activity. By combined atomic force microscopy and fluorescence imaging we generated mechanical and optical sections of single living cells. This approach allows the discrimination between К(cortex) and bulk cell stiffness (К(bulk)) and, additionally, the simultaneous analysis of submembranous actin web dynamics. We show that К(cortex) softens when cortical F-actin depolymerizes and that this shift from a gel-like stiff cortex to a soft G-actin rich layer, triggers the stiffness-sensitive eNOS activity. The results implicate that stiffness changes in the ∼100 nm phase of the submembranous actin web, without affecting К(bulk), regulate NO release and thus determines endothelial function.},

abstract = {We show that hemispherical gold droplets on top of silicon nanowires when grown by the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism, can produce a significant enhancement of Raman scattered signals. Signal enhancement for a few or even just single gold droplets is demonstrated by analyzing the enhanced Raman signature of malachite green molecules. For this experiment, trenches (approximately 800 nm wide) were etched in a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer along <110> crystallographic directions that constitute sidewalls (\{110\} surfaces) suitable for the growth of silicon nanowires in <111> directions with the intention that the gold droplets on the silicon nanowires can meet somewhere in the trench when growth time is carefully selected. Another way to realize gold nanostructures in close vicinity is to attach a silicon nanowire with a gold droplet onto an atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip and to bring this tip toward another gold-coated AFM tip where malachite green molecules were deposited prior to the measurements. In both experiments, signal enhancement of characteristic Raman bands of malachite green molecules was observed. This indicates that silicon nanowires with gold droplets atop can act as efficient probes for tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS). In our article, we show that a nanowire TERS probe can be fabricated by welding nanowires with gold droplets to AFM tips in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). TERS tips made from nanowires could improve the spatial resolution of Raman spectroscopy so that measurements on the nanometer scale are possible.},

The diagnosis of Barrett's oesophagus is based both on endoscopy and histology. The surveillance of patients relies on systematic biopsy sampling, looking for dysplasia - intraepithelial neoplasia. Well established classifications of dysplasia are now used by pathologists, but there remain problems with this marker. Therefore, many alternative biomarkers have been proposed, that remain of limited interest in daily practice, including DNA-ploidy, proliferation markers, and p53 abnormalities. Endoscopic improvements already allow a better selection of biopsies, and it may be that new technologies will allow 'virtual biopsies'. The role of pathologists is now extended to the evaluation of new therapeutic modalities of early neoplastic lesions in Barrett's oesophagus, especially endoscopic mucosal resection.},

abstract = {The mechanical response, the force-indentation relationship, in normal force spectroscopy measurements carried out on individual polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria is modeled using three increasingly refined approaches that consider the elastic response of the bacterium and cantilever in combination with a fluid (hydrodynamic) model for the polysaccharide layer. For the hydrodynamic description of the polysaccharide layer, several increasingly realistic models are described in detail, together with numerical solution techniques. These models range from one-dimensional, Newtonian, to two-dimensional, axisymmetric, fully viscoelastic (Phan-Thien/Tanner). In all cases, the models rigorously consider the time-dependent rheological-mechanical coupling between the elastic and fluid viscoelastic physical components of the experimental setup. Effects of inherent variability in geometrical and material properties of the bacterium and polysaccharide layer on the measurable response are quantified. A parametric investigation of the force-indentation relationship highlights the importance of accurate knowledge of the rheology of the extracellular polysaccharides. We also draw conclusions about the design and evaluation of force spectroscopy experiments on single encapsulated bacteria. Supported by model calculations, we also point the way to methods of in vivo rheological characterization of the extracellular polysaccharide as a preferable alternative to characterization after its removal from the native environment.},

Comparative analysis using atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the utility of atomic force microscopy for examining tissue morphology, and its ability to generate data allowing differentiation of cells from different origins to be monitored. At low resolution atomic force microscopy produced topographic data complementary to scanning electron microscopy images, whilst at high resolution atomic force microscopy captured novel cell surface structural detail for both epithelial and neuronal cell types. Analysis of surface roughness provided biophysical data which enabled qualitative and quantitative differences between samples to be measured. This study provides an important optimization of sample preparation enabling more generalized atomic force microscopy utilization for cellular analysis required for advanced cell surface morphological studies.},

abstract = {Hemodynamic shear stress regulates endothelial cell biochemical processes that govern cytoskeletal contractility, focal adhesion dynamics, and extracellular matrix assembly. Since shear stress causes rapid strain focusing at discrete locations in the cytoskeleton, we hypothesized that shear stress coordinately alters structural dynamics in the cytoskeleton, focal adhesion sites, and extracellular matrix on a time scale of minutes. Using multi-wavelength 4-D fluorescence microscopy, we measured the displacement of rhodamine-fibronectin and of GFP-labeled actin, vimentin, paxillin, and/or vinculin in aortic endothelial cells before and after onset of steady unidirectional shear stress. In the cytoskeleton, the onset of shear stress increased actin polymerization into lamellipodia, altered the angle of lateral displacement of actin stress fibers and vimentin filaments, and decreased centripetal remodeling of actin stress fibers in both subconfluent and confluent cell layers. Shear stress induced the formation of new focal complexes and reduced the centripetal remodeling of focal adhesions in regions of new actin polymerization. The structural dynamics of focal adhesions and the fibronectin matrix varied with cell density. In subconfluent cell layers, shear stress onset decreased the displacement of focal adhesions and fibronectin fibrils. In confluent monolayers, the direction of fibronectin and focal adhesion displacement shifted significantly towards the downstream direction within one minute after onset of shear stress. These spatially coordinated rapid changes in the structural dynamics of cytoskeleton, focal adhesions, and extracellular matrix are consistent with focusing of mechanical stress and/or strain near major sites of shear stress-mediated mechanotransduction.},

abstract = {Cytoskeletal alterations in endothelial cells have been linked to nitric oxide generation and cell-cell interactions. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta has been described to affect cytoskeletal rearrangement in numerous cell types; however, the underlying pathway is unclear. In the present study, we found that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) have marked cytoskeletal alterations with short-term TGF-beta treatment resulting in filipodia formation and F-actin assembly. The cytoskeletal alterations were blocked by the novel TGF-beta type I receptor/ALK5 kinase inhibitor (SB-505124) but not by the p38 kinase inhibitor (SB-203580). TGF-beta also induced marked stimulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within 5 min of TGF-beta exposure. TGF-beta stimulation of ROS was mediated by the NAPDH oxidase homolog Nox4 as DPI, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, and dominant-negative Nox4 adenovirus blocked ROS production. Finally, inhibition of ROS with ROS scavengers or dominant-negative Nox4 blocked the TGF-beta effect on cytoskeleton changes in endothelial cells. In conclusion, our studies show for the first time that TGF-beta-induced ROS production in human endothelial cells is via Nox4 and that TGF-beta alteration of cytoskeleton in HUVEC is mediated via a Nox4-dependent pathway.},

abstract = {Breakdown of the inner endothelial blood-retinal barrier (BRB), as occurs in diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, retinal vein occlusions, uveitis and other chronic retinal diseases, results in vasogenic edema and neural tissue damage, causing loss of vision. The central mechanism of altered BRB function is a change in the permeability characteristics of retinal endothelial cells caused by elevated levels of growth factors, cytokines, advanced glycation end products, inflammation, hyperglycemia and loss of pericytes. Subsequently, paracellular but also transcellular transport across the retinal vascular wall increases via opening of endothelial intercellular junctions and qualitative and quantitative changes in endothelial caveolar transcellular transport, respectively. Functional changes in pericytes and astrocytes, as well as structural changes in the composition of the endothelial glycocalyx and the basal lamina around BRB endothelium further facilitate BRB leakage. As Starling's rules apply, active transcellular transport of plasma proteins by the BRB endothelial cells causing increased interstitial osmotic pressure is probably the main factor in the formation of macular edema. The understanding of the complex cellular and molecular processes involved in BRB leakage has grown rapidly in recent years. Although appropriate animal models for human conditions like diabetic macular edema are lacking, these insights have provided tools for rational design of drugs aimed at restoring the BRB as well as for design of effective transport of drugs across the BRB, to treat the chronic retinal diseases such as DME that affect the quality-of-life of millions of patients.},

abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important but not yet fully defined role in the expression of inflammatory genes such as monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. We used complementary molecular and biochemical approaches to explore the roles of specific ROS and their molecular linkage to inflammatory signaling in endothelial cells. Adenovirus-mediated expression of superoxide dismutase and catalase inhibited TNF-alpha-induced MCP-1 gene expression, suggesting important roles of superoxide (O(2)(-).) and H(2)O(2) in MCP-1 gene activation. In addition, the iron chelator 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one and the hydroxyl radical scavengers dimethylthiourea and dimethyl sulfoxide inhibited TNF-alpha-induced MCP-1 expression, suggesting important roles of iron and hydroxyl radicals in inflammatory signal activation. In contrast, scavenging of peroxynitrite with 5,10,15,20-tetrakis-(4-sulfonatophenyl)prophyrinato iron (III) chloride had no effect on TNF-alpha-induced MCP-1 expression. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase, the major oxidase responsible for O(2)(-). generation, with diphenylene iodonium suppressed TNF-alpha-induced MCP-1 mRNA accumulation. Rac1 is an upstream signaling molecule for the activation of NADPH oxidase and O(2)(-). generation. Expression of dominant negative N17Rac1 by adenovirus suppressed TNF-alpha-induced MCP-1 mRNA levels and MCP-1 protein secretion. Expression of N17Rac1 inhibited TNF-alpha-induced MCP-1 and NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. These data suggest that ROS such as superoxide and H(2)O(2) derived from Rac1-activated NADPH oxidase mediate TNF-alpha-induced MCP-1 expression in endothelial cells.},

abstract = {Tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha-) generates both apoptotic and survival signals with endothelial cell (EC) survival dependent on nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkappaB) activation, a regulator of anti-apoptotic genes. We previously demonstrated that increased EC contractility, rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, and increased myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation occurs as a consequence of TNFalpha-induced activation of EC MLC kinase (EC MLCK) and is required for bovine lung EC apoptosis. As the association between MLCK and pro-survival signals such as NFkappaB activation is unknown, we studied the role of MLCK in the regulation of NFkappaB-dependent transactivation in bovine pulmonary artery EC. Both TNFalpha-induced increase in NFkappaB dependent transactivation measured by NFkappaB luciferase reporter assay (approximately fivefold) and nuclear translocation of NFkappaB were significantly inhibited by MLCK-selective inhibitors, KT5926 (60\% inhibition of luciferase activity) and ML7 (50\% decrease). Furthermore, our data revealed that inhibition of MLCK attenuated the TNFalpha-induced IkappaB phosphorylation, translocation of p65, NFkappaB-DNA binding, and NFkappaB transcriptional activity. Molecular approaches to either reduce EC MLCK expression (AdV EC MLCK antisense construct) or to reduce kinase activity (kinase-dead EC MLCK ATPdel mutant) produced similar attenuation of the TNFalpha-induced NFkappaB response. In contrast, a constitutively active MLCK mutant (EC MLCK1745) enhanced TNFalpha-induced luciferase activity. Together, these novel observations indicate that TNFalpha-induced cytoskeletal rearrangement driven by MLCK activity is necessary for TNFalpha-dependent NFkappaB activation and amplification of pro-survival signals.},

The raft hypothesis is based on the behavior of defined lipid mixtures in liposomes and other model membranes. Experiments in these well-characterized systems led to operational definitions for lipid rafts in cell membranes. These definitions, detergent solubility to define components of rafts, and sensitivity to cholesterol deprivation to define raft functions implicated sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in many cell functions. Despite extensive work, the basis for raft formation in cell membranes and the size of rafts and their stability are all uncertain. Recent work converges on very small rafts <10 nm in diameter that may enlarge and stabilize when their constituents are cross-linked.},

abstract = {The endothelial glycocalyx is well endowed with the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronan. The current studies aimed to assess the relative contributions of each of these GAGs to the thickness and permeability of the glycocalyx layer by direct enzymatic removal of each using micropipettes to infuse heparinase, chondroitinase and hyaluronidase into post-capillary venules of the intestinal mesentery of the rat. The relative losses of GAGs due to enzymatic removal were compared with stimulated shedding of glycans induced by superfusing the mesentery with 10(-)(7)M fMLP. Thickness of the glycocalyx was assessed by infiltration of the glycocalyx with circulating FITC labeled 70kDa dextran (Dx70) and measuring the distance from the dye front to the surface of the endothelium (EC), which averaged 463nm under control conditions. Reductions in thickness were 43.3\%, 34.1\% and 26.1\% following heparinase, chondroitinase and hyaluronidase, respectively, and 89.7\% with a mixture of all three enzymes. Diffusion coefficients of FITC in the glycocalyx were determined using a 1-D diffusion model. By comparison of measured transients in radial intensity of a bolus of FITC with that of a computational model a diffusion coefficient D was obtained. Values of D were obtained corresponding to the thickness of the layer demarcated by Dx70 (D(Dx70)), and a smaller sublayer 173nm above the EC surface (D(173)), prior to and following enzyme infusion and superfusion with fMLP. The magnitude of D(Dx70) was twice that of D(173) suggesting that the glycocalyx is more compact near the EC surface. Chondroitinase and hyaluronidase significantly increased both D(Dx70) and D(173). However, heparinase decreased D(Dx70), and did not induce any significant change for the D(173). These observations suggest that the three GAGs are not evenly distributed throughout the glycocalyx and that they each contribute to permeability of the glycocalyx to a differing extent. The fMLP-induced shedding caused a reduction in glycocalyx thickness (which may increase permeability) and as with heparinase, decreased the diffusion coefficient of solutes (which may decrease permeability). This behavior suggests that the removal of heparan sulfate may cause a collapse of the glycocalyx which counters decreases in thickness by compacting the layer to maintain a constant resistance to filtration.},

@article{Guolla2012,
abstract = {It is becoming clear that mechanical stimuli are crucial factors in regulating the biology of the cell, but the short-term structural response of a cell to mechanical forces remains relatively poorly understood. We mechanically stimulated cells transiently expressing actin-EGFP with controlled forces (0-20 nN) in order to investigate the structural response of the cell. Two clear force-dependent responses were observed: a short-term (seconds) local deformation of actin stress fibres and a long-term (minutes) force-induced remodelling of stress fibres at cell edges, far from the point of contact. By photobleaching markers along stress fibres we were also able to quantify strain dynamics occurring along the fibres throughout the cell. The results reveal that the cell exhibits complex heterogeneous negative and positive strain fluctuations along stress fibres in resting cells that indicate localized contraction and stretch dynamics. The application of mechanical force results in the activation of myosin contractile activity reflected in an \~{}50\% increase in strain fluctuations. This approach has allowed us to directly observe the activation of myosin in response to mechanical force and the effects of cytoskeletal crosslinking on local deformation and strain dynamics. The results demonstrate that force application does not result in simplistic isotropic deformation of the cytoarchitecture, but rather a complex and localized response that is highly dependent on an intact microtubule network. Direct visualization of force-propagation and stress fibre strain dynamics have revealed several crucial phenomena that take place and ultimately govern the downstream response of a cell to a mechanical stimulus.},

They are prominent players in energy conversion and integrated signaling pathways including regulation of Ca2+ signals and apoptosis. Their functional versatility is matched by their morphological plasticity and by their high mobility, allowing their transport at specialized cellular sites. This transport occurs by interactions with a variety of cytoskeletal proteins that also have the ability to influence shape and function of the organelle. A growing body of evidence suggests that mitochondria use cytoskeletal proteins as tracks for their movement; in turn, mitochondrial morphology and function is regulated via mostly uncharacterized pathways, by the cytoskeleton.},

The Raman spectra of tempyo labeled proteins in the pH 6.7-11 range were compared to those of the corresponding free species. The SERS spectra were interpreted in terms of the structural changes of the tempyo labeled proteins adsorbed on the silver colloidal surface. The tempyo spin label was found to be inactive in the Raman-RR and SERS spectra of the proteins. The alpha-helix conformation was concluded to be more favorable as the SERS binding site of bovine serum albumin. In the cytochrome c the enhancement of the bands assigned to the porphyrin macrocycle stretching mode allowed the supposition of the N-adsorption onto the colloidal surface.},

abstract = {The degree of mechanical stiffness of vascular endothelial cells determines the endogenous production of the vasodilating gas nitric oxide (NO). However, the underlying mechanisms are not yet understood. Experiments on vascular endothelial cells suggest that the electrical plasma membrane potential is involved in this regulatory process. To test this hypothesis we developed a technique that simultaneously measures the electrical membrane potential and stiffness of vascular endothelial cells (GM7373 cell line derived from bovine aortic endothelium) under continuous perfusion with physiological electrolyte solution. The cellular stiffness was determined by nano-indentation using an atomic force microscope (AFM) while the electrical membrane potential was measured with bis-oxonol, a voltage-reporting fluorescent dye. These two methods were combined using an AFM attached to an epifluorescence microscope. The electrical membrane potential and mechanical stiffness of the same cell were continuously recorded for a time span of 5 min. Fast fluctuations (in the range of seconds) of both the electrical membrane potential and mechanical stiffness could be observed that were not related to each other. In contrast, slow cell depolarizations (in the range of minutes) were paralleled by significant increases in mechanical stiffness. In conclusion, using the combined AFM-fluorescence technique we monitored for the first time simultaneously the electrical plasma membrane potential and mechanical stiffness in a living cell. Vascular endothelial cells exhibit oscillatory non-synchronized waves of electrical potential and mechanical stiffness. The sustained membrane depolarization, however, is paralleled by a concomitant increase of cell stiffness. The described method is applicable for any fluorophore, which opens new perspectives in biomedical research.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial response of EA.hy926 endothelial cells to tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) was inves- tigated. It was confirmed that TNF stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and increases intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) level. These changes were paralleled by elevated oxygen consumption, slightly raised total mitochondrial mass and increased manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) content. They also correlated with a rise of mitochondrial transcription factor 1 (TFAM), nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- coactivator (PGC)-1, which are involved in regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and an elevated level of selected respiratory chain proteins. Thus, the apparent stimulatory effect of TNF on mitochondrial metabolism probably reflects an increased amount of mitochondria rather than activation of biochemical processes per se, although the latter cannot be excluded definitely. These observations are similar to those described for cardiac muscle cells challenged with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in which mitochondrial biogenesis was postulated. Stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis could be a mechanism activated to prevent TNF-induced cell death. ©},

abstract = {Histopathology remains the gold standard technique for the diagnosis of intraepithelial neoplasia (dysplasia) in Barrett's oesophagus, but it is highly subjective and relies on blind biopsy targeting. The aim of this study was to evaluate Raman spectroscopy, a rapid, non-invasive, molecular, specific analytical technique, for the objective identification and classification of Barrett's neoplasia in vitro. A secondary objective was to demonstrate the need for a rigorous gold standard in the development of new diagnostic techniques. Forty-four patients with a mean age of 69 years (range 34-89 years) undergoing surveillance for Barrett's oesophagus were included in the study. Three consultant pathologists independently assessed snap-frozen oesophageal biopsy specimens. Raman spectra were measured on 87 histopathologically homogeneous samples. Spectral classification models were developed using multivariate analysis for the prediction of pathology. Histopathology and Raman classification results were compared. Raman spectral prediction with a consensus pathology classification model gave sensitivities between 73\% and 100\% and specificities of 90-100\%. A high level of agreement (kappa = 0.89) was demonstrated between the three-subset biopsy targeting model and consensus pathology opinion. This compares favourably with the agreement measured between an independent pathologist and the consensus pathology opinion for the same spectra (kappa = 0.76). Raman spectroscopy appears to provide a highly sensitive and specific technique for the identification and classification of neoplasia in Barrett's oesophagus.},

abstract = {The cytoskeleton, composed of actin filaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules, is a highly dynamic supramolecular network actively involved in many essential biological mechanisms such as cellular structure, transport, movements, differentiation, and signaling. As a first step to characterize the biophysical changes associated with cytoskeleton functions, we have developed finite elements models of the organization of the cell that has allowed us to interpret atomic force microscopy (AFM) data at a higher resolution than that in previous work. Thus, by assuming that living cells behave mechanically as multilayered structures, we have been able to identify superficial and deep effects that could be related to actin and microtubule disassembly, respectively. In Cos-7 cells, actin destabilization with Cytochalasin D induced a decrease of the visco-elasticity close to the membrane surface, while destabilizing microtubules with Nocodazole produced a stiffness decrease only in deeper parts of the cell. In both cases, these effects were reversible. Cell softening was measurable with AFM at concentrations of the destabilizing agents that did not induce detectable effects on the cytoskeleton network when viewing the cells with fluorescent confocal microscopy. All experimental results could be simulated by our models. This technology opens the door to the study of the biophysical properties of signaling domains extending from the cell surface to deeper parts of the cell.},

abstract = {The proliferation and motility of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are critical steps in angiogenesis and are strictly controlled by different extracellular signals. Among mitogens, peptides binding to tyrosine kinase receptors (i.e. VEGFs and FGFs) are well known and are released by several cell types, including ECs and tumor cells. The binding of mitogens to their specific receptors triggers intracellular signaling cascades, involving a number of messengers working in a sort of network. In particular, in this review we describe the increases of calcium levels in the cytosol, a universal, evolutionary conserved and highly versatile signal involved in the regulation of EC's proliferation and motility.  Most mitogens, including angiogenic factors, generate cytosolic calcium rises through two mechanisms: entry from extracellular medium, through the opening of calcium permeable channels in the plasma membrane, or release from intracellular organelles (mainly endoplasmic reticulum, ER).  Calcium entry, the main topic of this review, can be dependent on previously IP3-activated emptying of calcium stores (store-dependent or capacitative calcium entry - CCE), or independent on it (non capacitative calcium entry, NCCE). The intracellular pathways underlying calcium entry are under investigation and recently arachidonic acid (AA) and nitric oxide (NO) metabolism have been suggested to play a key role, at least in some cell types. Even if some calcium entry blockers are under clinical trial with encouraging results, a better knowledge about the molecular nature of calcium channels and their intracellular regulation, together with a more detailed description of spatiotemporal dynamics of intracellular calcium events, could lead to new and more specific strategies in therapeutical approach to cancer progression and angiogenesis.},

abstract = {The indentation load-displacement behavior of six materials tested with a Berkovich indenter has been carefully documented to establish an improved method for determining hardness and elastic modulus from indentation load-displacement data. The materials included fused silica, soda-lime glass, and single crystals of aluminum, tungsten, quartz, and sapphire. It is shown that the load-displacement curves during unloading in these materials are not linear, even in the initial stages, thereby suggesting that the flat punch approximation used so often in the analysis of unloading data is not entirely adequate. An analysis technique is presented that accounts for the curvature in the unloading data and provides a physically justifiable procedure for determining the depth which should be used in conjunction with the indenter shape function to establish the contact area at peak load. The hardnesses and elastic moduli of the six materials are computed using the analysis procedure and compared with values determined by independent means to assess the accuracy of the method. The results show that with good technique, moduli can be measured to within 5\%.},

abstract = {Cytoskeletal alterations in endothelial cells have been linked to nitric oxide generation and cell-cell interactions. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta has been described to affect cytoskeletal rearrangement in numerous cell types; however, the underlying pathway is unclear. In the present study, we found that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) have marked cytoskeletal alterations with short-term TGF-beta treatment resulting in filipodia formation and F-actin assembly. The cytoskeletal alterations were blocked by the novel TGF-beta type I receptor/ALK5 kinase inhibitor (SB-505124) but not by the p38 kinase inhibitor (SB-203580). TGF-beta also induced marked stimulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within 5 min of TGF-beta exposure. TGF-beta stimulation of ROS was mediated by the NAPDH oxidase homolog Nox4 as DPI, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, and dominant-negative Nox4 adenovirus blocked ROS production. Finally, inhibition of ROS with ROS scavengers or dominant-negative Nox4 blocked the TGF-beta effect on cytoskeleton changes in endothelial cells. In conclusion, our studies show for the first time that TGF-beta-induced ROS production in human endothelial cells is via Nox4 and that TGF-beta alteration of cytoskeleton in HUVEC is mediated via a Nox4-dependent pathway.},

Several in vitro measurements of their elastic properties have therefore been made, but direct mechanical manipulation of individual SFs in vivo for the determination of their mechanical properties has not been attempted. No less important is a search for the possible formation of a global mechanical network involving SFs and other intracellular filamentous components. In this article, we present an application of atomic force microscopy to probe into a live cell and laterally push selected SFs in a fibroblast cells (VNOf 06 fibroblast-like cells derived from rat vomeronasal tissue) transfected with a green fluorescent protein-$\beta$-actin gene. The transfected cells were transferred to a serum-depleted medium before the atomic force microscope manipulation. The lateral displacement of the SFs under a point loading condition recorded on a fluorescence microscope revealed both linear and nonlinear displacements against the contour distance from the point of force loading. The nonlinear displacements of the SFs were attributed to their association with a cortical actomyosin-cell membrane complex that effectively pulled them back as a 2D thin plate. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Changes in temperature and chemical stimuli, such as pH, may alter the structure of the cell and its mechanical response. Thus, the mechanical properties may serve as an indicator for the cellular state. We applied dielectrophoretic forces to suspension cells by means of two microelectrodes. The resultant stretching was analyzed on consecutive cultivation days with respect to the influence of medium consumption. Systematic experiments clearly showed that the medium consumption affected the viscoelastic properties of the investigated human leukemia cells HL-60. The shift in pH value and the culture medium depletion were identified as potentially responsible for the differing temporal development of the cell deformation. Both factors were investigated separately and a detailed analysis indicated that the changes observed in the cellular stiffness were primarily attributable to nutrient depletion.},

Here, proteomics analyses revealed that levels of the nucleoskeletal protein lamin-A scaled with tissue elasticity, E, as did levels of collagens in the extracellular matrix that determine E. Stem cell differentiation into fat on soft matrix was enhanced by low lamin-A levels, whereas differentiation into bone on stiff matrix was enhanced by high lamin-A levels. Matrix stiffness directly influenced lamin-A protein levels, and, although lamin-A transcription was regulated by the vitamin A/retinoic acid (RA) pathway with broad roles in development, nuclear entry of RA receptors was modulated by lamin-A protein. Tissue stiffness and stress thus increase lamin-A levels, which stabilize the nucleus while also contributing to lineage determination.},

@article{Kamata1999,
abstract = {Extracellular stimuli elicit a variety of responses, such as cell proliferation and differentiation, through the cellular signalling system. Binding of growth factors to the respective receptor leads to the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, which in turn stimulate downstream signalling systems such as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. These biochemical reactions finally reach the nucleus, resulting in gene expression mediated by the activation of several transcription factors. Recent studies have revealed that cellular signalling pathways are regulated by the intracellular redox state. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as H2O2, leads to the activation of protein tyrosine kinases followed by the stimulation of downstream signalling systems including MAP kinase and PLCgamma. The activation of PLCgamma by oxidative radical stress elevates the cellular Ca2+ levels by flux from the intracellular Ca2+ pool and from the extracellular space. Such reactions in the upstream signalling cascade, in concert, result in the activation of several transcription factors. On the other hand, reductants generally suppress the upstream signalling cascade resulting in the suppression of transcription factors. However, it is well known that cysteine residues in a reduced state are essential for the activity of many transcription factors. In fact, in vitro, oxidation of NFkappaB results in its activation, whereas reductants promote its activity. Thus, cellular signalling pathways are generally subjected to dual redox regulation in which redox has opposite effects on upstream signalling systems and downstream transcription factors. Not only are the cellular signalling pathways subjected to redox regulation, but also the signalling systems regulate the cellular redox state. When cells are activated by extracellular stimuli, the cells produce ROS, which in turn stimulate other cellular signalling pathways, indicating that ROS act as second messengers. It is thus evident that there is cross talk between the cellular signalling system and the cellular redox state. Cell death and life also are subjected to such dual redox regulation and cross talk. Death signals induce apoptosis through the activation of caspases in the cells. Oxidative radical stress induces the activation of caspases, whereas the oxidation of caspases results in their inactivation. Furthermore, some cell-death signals induce the production of ROS in the cells, and the ROS produced in turn stimulate the cell-death machinery. All this evidence shows that the cell's fate is determined by cross talk between the cellular signalling pathways and the cellular redox state through a complicated regulation mechanism.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using the biomechanical properties of cells as biomarkers to discriminate between normal and cancerous cells. However, few investigators have considered the influence of the growth medium composition when evaluating the biomechanical properties of the normal and diseased cells. In this study, we investigated the variation in Young's modulus of non-malignant MCF10A and malignant MDA-MB-231 breast cells seeded in five different growth media under controlled experimental conditions. The average Young's modulus of MDA-MB-231 cells was significantly lower (p<0.0001) than the mean Young's modulus of MCF10A cells when compared in identical medium compositions. However, we found that growth medium composition affected the elasticity of MCF10A and MDA-MB-231 cells. The average Young's modulus of both cell lines decreased by 10-18\% when the serum was reduced from 10\% to 5\% and upon addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF, 20ng/ml) to the medium. Though these elasticity changes might have some biological impact, none was statistically significant. However, the elasticity of MCF10A was significantly more responsive than MDA-MB-231 cells to the medium composition supplemented with EGF, cholera toxin (CT), insulin (INS) and hydrocortisone (HC), which are recommended for routine cultivation of MCF10A cells (M5). MCF10A cells were significantly softer (p<0.002) when grown in medium M5 compared to a standard MDA-MB-231 medium (M1). The investigation of the effects of culture medium composition on the elastic properties of cells highlights the need to take these effects into consideration when interpreting elasticity measurements in cells grown in different media.},

abstract = {The mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone acts on target cells of kidney, colon, and the cardiovascular system through genomic and nongenomic pathways. Although the classical intracellular mineralocorticoid receptor plays a key role in mediating both pathways, it is unclear whether there are specific aldosterone receptors located on the cell surface. To search for such sites in vascular endothelium, we used an atomic force microscope (AFM) which measures unbinding forces based on single molecular recognition between an aldosterone-loaded AFM tip and the cell membrane. Aldosterone was tethered covalently via linker molecules to an AFM tip. Human endothelial cells (EA.hy926) were grown in culture and studied in buffer at 37 degrees C. Using the aldosterone-functionalized AFM tip as a mechanical nanoscale indenter, unbinding forces could be measured at randomly chosen sites of the plasma membrane. Sites with strong interactions between AFM tip and cell surface could be identified exhibiting unbinding forces of about 65 pN. The binding probability between the aldosterone-loaded tip and the cell surface at selected membrane sites was 53 +/- 7.2\%. Addition of an excess supply of aldosterone to the bath solution blocked the binding of the aldosterone-loaded tip to the cell surface. The binding probability was reduced to 8.0 +/- 1.8\% when an excess supply of aldosterone was added to the bath. However, it was not influenced by the addition of spironolactone or dexamethasone. We conclude that aldosterone receptor sites exist on the cell surface of vascular endothelial cells distinct from the classical mineralocorticoid receptors and insensitive to glucocorticoids. Binding of aldosterone to these receptors initiates an intracellular signaling cascade that precedes the classical genomic response and most likely participates in the control of vascular resistance.},

abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation has become an important technique for quantifying the mechanical properties of live cells at nanoscale. However, determination of cell elasticity modulus from the force-displacement curves measured in the AFM indentations is not a trivial task. The present work shows that these force-displacement curves are affected by indenter-cell adhesion force, while the use of an appropriate indentation model may provide information on the cell elasticity and the work of adhesion of the cell membrane to the surface of the AFM probes. A recently proposed indentation model (Sirghi, Rossi in Appl Phys Lett 89:243118, 2006), which accounts for the effect of the adhesion force in nanoscale indentation, is applied to the AFM indentation experiments performed on live cells with pyramidal indenters. The model considers that the indentation force equilibrates the elastic force of the cell cytoskeleton and the adhesion force of the cell membrane. It is assumed that the indenter-cell contact area and the adhesion force decrease continuously during the unloading part of the indentation (peeling model). Force-displacement curves measured in indentation experiments performed with silicon nitride AFM probes with pyramidal tips on live cells (mouse fibroblast Balb/c3T3 clone A31-1-1) in physiological medium at 37 degrees C agree well with the theoretical prediction and are used to determine the cell elasticity modulus and indenter-cell work of adhesion.},

abstract = {Hyperglycemia has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both micro- and macrovascular complications in diabetes. Little is known, however, about glucose transporters and their regulation in the vascular system. In this study, the regulation of glucose transporters by glucose was examined in cultured BAECs and BSMCs, and in human arterial smooth muscle cells. Both BAECs and BSMCs transported glucose via the facilitated diffusion transport system. Glucose-transport activity in vascular smooth muscle cells was inversely and reversibly regulated by glucose. Exposure of BSMCs and HSMCs to high glucose decreased Vmax for 2DG and 3-O-MG uptake, whereas Km remained unchanged. The hexose-transport system of BAECs exhibited lower 2DG and 3-O-MG uptake compared with BSMCs and showed little or no adaptation to changes in ambient glucose. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that GLUT1 mRNA levels in BAECs and BSMCs were unaffected by the concentration of glucose in the medium. GLUT2-5 mRNA could not be detected by Northern blot analysis. GLUT1 protein, quantified by Western blot analysis, was more abundant in BSMCs than in BAECs and was decreased by approximately 50\% when medium glucose was elevated from 1.2 to 22 mM for 24 h. The alterations in the level of GLUT1 protein correlated with the changes observed in transport activity. These observations suggest differential regulation of glucose transporter in response to glucose between smooth muscle and endothelial cells. The sites of autoregulation may involve translational control and/or the stability of the protein in the smooth muscle cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Mechanical parameters play a crucial role in proper cellular functions. This article examines the process of the appearance and breaking of adhesion forces during contact between the confluent cerebral endothelial cell layer and a melanoma cell attached to a tipless cantilever. This adhesion is the initial phase of melanoma transmigration through the endothelial cell layer. Taking the force measurement, if the contact was prolonged for several seconds, a decrease in the load force was observed, which corresponds to stress relaxation of the cells. The dependence of adhesion force and stress relaxation on dwell time showed a saturation-like behavior. These stress relaxation curves could be fitted with the sum of two exponentials, suggesting that two independent processes take place simultaneously. The breakup of the adhesion during the retraction of the cantilever with the attached melanoma cell is not continuous but shows jumps. Between living endothelial and melanoma cells, a minimum jump size of about 20 pN could be determined. The minimum jump is independent of the dwell time and load force. It seems to be the elementary binding force between these two cell types. In case of fixed endothelial cells, the adhesion force was strongly decreased and the jumps disappeared, whereas the stress relaxation did not show considerable change upon fixation.},

abstract = {The action of glucocorticoids on vascular permeability is well established. However, little is known about the action of mineralocorticoids on the structure and function of blood vessels. As endothelial cells are targets for both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, we exposed human umbilical vein endothelial cells to both types of steroids. Aldosterone (mineralocorticoid) and dexamethasone (glucocorticoid) were applied for 3 days in culture before measurements of transendothelial ion and macromolecule permeability, apical cell surface and cell stiffness were taken. Transendothelial ion permeability was measured with electrical cell impedance sensing, macromolecule permeability with fluorescence-labeled dextran and apical cell membrane surface by three-dimensional AFM imaging. Cell stiffness was measured using the AFM scanning tip as a mechanical nanosensor. We found that aldosterone increased both apical cell surface and apical cell stiffness significantly, while transendothelial permeability remained unaffected. By contrast, dexamethasone significantly decreased ion and macromolecule permeability, while apical cell surface and cell stiffness did not change. Specific receptor antagonists for dexamethasone (RU486) and aldosterone (spironolactone) prevented the observed responses. We conclude that glucocorticoids strengthen cell-to-cell contacts (;peripheral action'), whereas mineralocorticoids enlarge and stiffen cells (;central action'). This could explain the dexamethasone-mediated retention of fluid in the vascular system, and endothelial dysfunction in states of hyperaldosteronism.},

All markers, except EGFR, showed a significant trend for immunohistochemical protein overexpression during malignant progression in BE (P <.01). When the successive stages along the metaplasia-low-grade dysplasia (LGD)-high-grade dysplasia (HGD)-adenocarcinoma axis were compared, protein overexpression of beta-catenin separated LGD from metaplasia, whereas protein overexpression of cyclin D1 and p53 discriminated HGD from LGD (all P <.001). beta-Catenin can be helpful for a diagnosis of LGD in BE, although it stains positively in a subset only, whereas p53 remains an appropriate marker to define HGD. In case of doubt, cyclin D1 can be added to separate LGD from HGD in BE.},

@article{Ray2005,
abstract = {Intracellular ROS (reactive oxygen species) such as superoxide and H2O2 have been increasingly appreciated to have a role in endothelial pathophysiology. Of the several sources within the vasculature, a family of multi-subunit NADPH oxidases appears to be a predominant contributor of endothelial superoxide. More importantly, this enzyme system is activated by numerous stimuli and is involved in triggering diverse intracellular signalling pathways ('redox-sensitive' signalling pathways) that have a central role in conditions such as endothelial activation and inflammation, cell growth, apoptosis and hypertrophy. Furthermore, NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide contributes to the impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation by inactivating nitric oxide; the resultant endothelial dysfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetic vasculopathy and heart failure. A detailed understanding of the regulation of NADPH oxidases and their modulation and downstream effects may define novel therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment in the clinical setting, in contrast with global antioxidant therapy which has to date been disappointing.},

abstract = {Weibel-Palade bodies are ultrastructurally defined organelles found only in vascular endothelial cells. Because endothelium in corpo is very dispersed, isolation and further characterization of this organelle has been dependent on increasing the number of cells in culture. However, primary isolates of endothelial cells have a limited replication potential and tend to senesce in culture. In this report, EA.hy926, a continuously replicating cell line derived from human endothelium, is shown to contain Weibel-Palade bodies. Electron micrographs demonstrate the ultrastructural characteristics of these tissue-specific organelles and their cytoplasmic distribution in EA.hy926 cells. Von Willebrand factor, which has been shown to exist in Weibel Palade bodies, is demonstrated by immunofluorescence in discrete rod-shaped organelles whose size, shape, and distribution are consistent with that of Weibel-Palade bodies in primary endothelial cell cultures. Rapid release of von Willebrand factor can be induced by calcium ionophore, and large multimeric forms of the protein are found in EA.hy926 cells. These two properties are consistent with the function currently ascribed to Weibel Palade bodies: storage of multimerized von Willebrand factor. Thus ultrastructural, immunologic, and functional data establish the existence of this as yet poorly understood tissue-specific organelle in a continuous, vigorously replicating human cell line.},

abstract = {AIMS: The requirement of endothelial NO synthase (NOS3) calcium to produce NO is well described, although the effect of NO on intracellular calcium levels [Ca(2+)](i) is still confusing. Therefore, NO and [Ca(2+)](i) cross-talk were studied in parallel in endothelial cells possessing a functional or a dysfunctional NO pathway.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Dysfunctional porcine endothelial cells were obtained either in vitro by successive passages or in vivo from regenerated endothelium 1 month after coronary angioplasty. Activity of NOS3 was characterized by conversion of arginine to citrulline, BH(4) intracellular availability, cGMP, and superoxide anion production. Imaging of the Ca(2+) indicator FURA 2-AM was recorded and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) pump activity was analysed by (45)Ca(2+) uptake into cells. In endothelial cells with a functional NO pathway, NOS3 inhibition increased [Ca(2+)](i) and, conversely, an NO donor decreased it. In aged cells with an uncoupled NOS3 as shown by the reduced BH(4) level, the increase in superoxide anion and the lower production of cGMP and the decrease in NO bioavailability were linearly correlated with the increase in basal [Ca(2+)](i). Moreover, when stimulated by bradykinin, the calcium response was reduced while its decay was slowed down. These effects on the calcium signalling were abolished in calcium-free buffer and were similarly induced by SERCA inhibitors. In aged cells, NO improved the reduced SERCA activity and tended to normalize the agonist calcium response.

CONCLUSION: In control endothelial cells, NO exerts a negative feedback on cytosolic Ca(2+) homeostasis. In aged cells, uncoupled NOS3 produced NO that was insufficient to control the [Ca(2+)](i). Consequently, under resting conditions, SERCA activity decreased and [Ca(2+)](i) increased. These alterations were reversible as exogenous NO, in a cGMP-independent way, refilled intracellular calcium stores, reduced calcium influx, and improved the agonist-evoked calcium response. Therefore, prevention of the decrease in NO in dysfunctional endothelium would normalize the calcium-dependent functions.},

Whilst cultured cells have been prepared for AFM analysis using a variety of matrices and fixatives, a definitive study of sample preparation and its effects on cell morphology has not, as far as the authors are aware, previously been reported. Although a considerable number of cell fixatives exist, no single fixative is ideal for all investigations. Prior to the performance of specialised techniques, such as atomic force microscopy of cultured cells in air, the cell fixation method must be investigated and optimised. The fixative abilities of 2\% paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate, 0.25\% glutaraldehyde, paraformaldehyde-glutaraldehyde, 4\% phosphate-buffered formal saline, 1\% formaldehyde, methanol:acetone, formal saline, 4\% paraformaldehyde and ethanol:acetic acid were assessed in this study. A qualitative assessment system was used to evaluate the efficacy of the above fixatives using conventional fixation criteria (i.e. the presence of fibroblastic morphology consistent with optical microscopy and the absence of fixation artifacts). The optimal fixative was identified as 4\% paraformaldehyde, which was capable of providing optically consistent images of BHK-21 (fibroblastic) cells, whose heights remained within the measurement capability of the AFM instrument used in this study.},

abstract = {Sodium overload stiffens vascular endothelial cells in vitro and promotes arterial hypertension in vivo. The hypothesis was tested that the endothelial glycocalyx (eGC), a mesh of anionic biopolymers covering the surface of the endothelium, participates in the stiffening process. By using a mechanical nanosensor, mounted on an atomic force microscope, height (∼400 nm) and stiffness (∼0.25 pN/nm) of the eGC on the luminal endothelial surface of split-open human umbilical arteries were quantified. In presence of aldosterone, the increase of extracellular sodium concentration from 135 to 150 mM over 5 days (sodium overload) led the eGC shrink by ∼50\% and stiffening by ∼130\%. Quantitative eGC analyses reveal that sodium overload caused a reduction of heparan sulphate residues by 68\% which lead to destabilization and collapse of the eGC. Sodium overload transformed the endothelial cells from a sodium release into a sodium-absorbing state. Spironolactone, a specific aldosterone antagonist, prevented these changes. We conclude that the endothelial glycocalyx serves as an effective buffer barrier for sodium. Damaged eGC facilitates sodium entry into the endothelial cells. This could explain endothelial dysfunction and arterial hypertension observed in sodium abuse.},

abstract = {Endothelium forms a semi-permeable barrier that separates blood from the underlying tissue. Barrier function is largely determined by cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions that define the limits of cell borders. Yet, such cell-cell and cell-matrix tethering is critically reliant upon the nature of adherence within the cell itself. Indeed, the actin cytoskeleton fulfills this essential function, to provide a strong, dynamic intracellular scaffold that organizes integral membrane proteins with the cell’s interior, and responds to environmental cues to orchestrate appropriate cell shape. The actin cytoskeleton is comprised of three distinct, but interrelated structures, including actin cross-linking of spectrin within the membrane skeleton, the cortical actin rim, and actomyosin-based stress fibers. This review addresses each of these actin-based structures, and discusses cellular signals that control the disposition of actin in different endothelial cell phenotypes.},

The results show that the stiffness for 1-micron-long actin filaments with and without tropomyosin is 65.3 +/- 6.3 and 43.7 +/- 4.6 pN/nm, respectively. When the distribution of crossbridge forces along the actin filament is taken into account, the elongation of a 1-micron-long thin filament during development of isometric contraction is calculated to be approximately 0.23\%. The time constant of force in response to a sudden length change is < 0.2 ms, indicating that the viscoelasticity is negligible in the millisecond time range. These results suggest that approximately 50\% of the sarcomere compliance of active muscle is due to extensibility of the thin filaments.},

It is shown that the effectiveness of fibroblast cell detachment depends on the cell age, laser power, and AuNP patterning profile. Heat distribution and temperature rise around gold nanoparticle functionalized surfaces is modeled, revealing low heating of nanoparticles by laser illumination. The nonthermal photochemical mechanism of cell detachment due to production of reactive oxygen species under illumination of gold nanoparticles by green laser light is studied. We also demonstrate that cells migrate from unirradiated areas leading to their reattachment and surface recovery which is important for controlled spatial organization of cells in wound healing and tissue engineering.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Experiments were designed to assess whether or not the intracellular concentration of calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase in endothelial cells of the rat thoracic aorta in response to releasers of endothelium-derived contracting factor (EDCF) and if so, whether or not a difference exists between spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive (WKY) rats.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Calcium and ROS were measured by confocal microscopy, using Fura-red in combination with Fluo-4 and dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, respectively.

KEY RESULTS: Acetylcholine caused a rapid increase in cytosolic calcium concentration in endothelial cells of both SHR and WKY, which was significantly more pronounced in aortae of the former strain. This rise of calcium was not affected by indomethacin (an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase) or Tiron plus diethyldithiocarbamate acid (DETCA) (membrane permeable antioxidants). In the presence of a nitric oxide synthase blocker, acetylcholine also caused a rapid increase in ROS in endothelial cells of SHR but not in those of WKY. The burst of ROS was prevented by indomethacin or Tiron plus DETCA.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These experiments show that endothelial cells of SHR are more prone to calcium and ROS overload upon stimulation with acetylcholine. The abnormal accumulation of calcium is a prerequisite to initiate the release of EDCF and can be mimicked using the calcium ionophore A23187. The sequence of events occurring during endothelium-dependent contractions firstly requires the accumulation of calcium, which then activates cyclooxygenase and produces ROS along with EDCF that in turn stimulates TP-receptors, resulting in EDCF-mediated contractions.},

This is done by the study of a new internal dissipation term into the Euler-Bernoulli equation. This term remains valid in ultra-high vacuum, and becomes particularly relevant when viscous dissipation with the fluid environment becomes negligible. We derive a compact explicit equation for the quality factor versus pressure for all the flexural modes. This expression is used to compare with corresponding extant high vacuum experiments. We demonstrate that a single internal dissipation parameter and a single viscosity parameter provide enough information to reproduce the first three experimental flexural resonances at all pressures. The new term introduced here has a mesoscopic origin in the relative motion between adjacent layers in the cantilever.},

abstract = {By using magnetic bead microrheology we study the effect of inflammatory agents and toxins on the viscoelastic moduli of endothelial cell plasma membranes in real time. Viscoelastic response curves were acquired by applying short force pulses of \~{}500 pN to fibronectin-coated magnetic beads attached to the surface membrane of endothelial cells. Upon addition of thrombin, a rapid stiffening of the membrane was observed within 5 s, followed by recovery of the initial deformability within 2 min. By using specific inhibitors, two known pathways by which thrombin induces actin reorganization in endothelial cells, namely activation of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase and stimulation of Rho/Rho-kinase, were excluded as possible causes of the stiffening effect. Interestingly, the cytotoxic necrotizing factor of Escherichia coli, a toxin which, in addition to Rho, activates the GTPases Rac and CDC42Hs, also induced a dramatic stiffening effect, suggesting that the stiffening may be mediated through a Rac- or Cdc42Hs-dependent pathway. This work demonstrates that magnetic bead microrheometry is not only a powerful tool to determine the absolute viscoelastic moduli of the composite cell plasma membrane, but also a valuable tool to study in real time the effect of drugs or toxins on the viscoelastic parameters of the plasma membrane.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate anti-tumor effect of the recombined adenovirus encoding NK4 gene regulated by human telomerase reverse transcriptase (HTERT) promoter (Ad HTERTp-NK4) on human colon cancer. METHODS: Colon cell line HCT116 was infected with Ad HTERTp-NK4. NK4 expression was determined by RT-PCR and Western blot. The cell-growth inhibition rate and the invasive capacity of cells were evaluated by MTT method and reconstituted basement membrane invasion assay. The model of subcutaneous tumor was generated by injection of HCT116 cells into the dorsum of nude mice. Ad HTERTp-NK4 was injected around the tumor tissues, and tumor growth was observed. RESULTS: NK4 gene was highly expressed in infected HCT116 cells. The cell growth inhibition rate and the invasive inhibition rate in Ad HTERTp-NK4 cells were 47.14\% and 40.63\% respectively, which were significantly higher than those in the control cells (2.75\% and 2.31\%, P<0.05). Tumor growth was significantly inhibited in mice injected with Ad HTERTp-NK4, and the tumor growth inhibition rate was 47.3\%, which was significantly higher than that in the controls(4.6\%, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Ad HTERTp-NK4 can inhibit tumor growth and decrease the invasive capacity of tumor cells, which makes it an ideal candidate for new gene therapy for colon carcinoma.},

abstract = {We have provided evidence that mitochondrial membrane permeability transition induced by inorganic phosphate, uncouplers or prooxidants such as t-butyl hydroperoxide and diamide is caused by a Ca(2+)-stimulated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the respiratory chain, at the level of the coenzyme Q. The ROS attack to membrane protein thiols produces cross-linkage reactions, that may open membrane pores upon Ca2+ binding. Studies with submitochondrial particles have demonstrated that the binding of Ca2+ to these particles (possibly to cardiolipin) induces lipid lateral phase separation detected by electron paramagnetic resonance experiments exploying stearic acids spin labels. This condition leads to a disorganization of respiratory chain components, favoring ROS production and consequent protein and lipid oxidation.},

The observed bands indicate a trans conformation of the azobenzene moieties and are in agreement with structural data for the molecular layer.

For this purpose a TERS spectral map was measured on the biomembrane model, using a step size far below the diffraction limit. Considering the model composition, spectra were classified as either typical for lipids, proteins or both simultaneously, in a qualitative manner. Subsequently, the spectroscopic information was assigned with respect to the topographic features. Since a spatial differentiation between different compositional domains is difficult to achieve by topographic features only, the combination of morphology and spectral data enables a much more detailed characterization of biomembranes.},

abstract = {Glutaraldehyde-fixed red blood cells were imaged by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TMAFM) in air at room temperature. The results show that TMAFM can visualize the morphology of the red blood cell at both cellular and nanometer scales. The scan size covers the range from several hundred nanometers to more than one hundred micrometers. TMAFM not only has a higher resolution than the optical microscope, but also can observe biological samples without precoating as required for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The AFM images of the entire surface of an uncoated red blood cell with nanometer resolution are successfully reconstructed by 28 AFM images of the preselected subareas on the surface of the red blood cell. These images reveal directly the fine structures of the external surface of uncoated red blood cells in air. The surface exhibits a characteristic structure composed of a large number of closely-packed nanometer particles with a size ranging from a few nanometers to tens of nanometers. These "particulate" components are evenly distributed, and no jumping protrusion or depression structures were found. These particles give rise to a very smooth surface of the red blood cell as shown in a large-scan AFM image. In addition, the 28 AFM images obtained by the continuous scanning over 3 hours indicate that TMAFM can image soft biological samples such as red blood cells stably and reproducibly.},

abstract = {In the present study, the association of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) with the actin cytoskeleton in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) was examined. We found that the protein contents of eNOS, actin, and caveolin-1 were significantly higher in the caveolar fraction of plasma membranes than in the noncaveolar fraction of plasma membranes in PAEC. Immunoprecipitation of eNOS from lysates of caveolar fractions of plasma membranes in PAEC resulted in the coprecipitation of actin, and immunoprecipitation of actin from lysates of caveolar fractions resulted in the coprecipitation of eNOS. Confocal microscopy of PAEC, in which eNOS was labeled with fluorescein, F-actin was labeled with Texas red-phalloidin, and G-actin was labeled with deoxyribonuclease I conjugated with Texas red, also demonstrated an association between eNOS and F-actin or G-actin. Incubation of purified eNOS with purified F-actin and G-actin resulted in an increase in eNOS activity. The increase in eNOS activity caused by G-actin was much higher than that caused by F-actin. Incubation of PAEC with swinholide A, an actin filament disruptor, resulted in an increase in eNOS activity, eNOS protein content, and association of eNOS with G-actin and in a decrease in the association of eNOS with F-actin. The increase in eNOS activity was higher than that in eNOS protein content in swinholide A-treated cells. In contrast, exposure of PAEC to phalloidin, an actin filament stabilizer, caused decreases in eNOS activity and association of eNOS with G-actin and increases in association of eNOS with F-actin. These results suggest that eNOS is associated with actin in PAEC and that actin and its polymerization state play an important role in the regulation of eNOS activity.},

abstract = {Tissue cells lack the ability to see or hear but have evolved mechanisms to feel into their surroundings and sense a collective stiffness. A cell can even sense the effective stiffness of rigid objects that are not in direct cellular contact - like the proverbial princess who feels a pea placed beneath soft mattresses. How deeply a cell feels into a matrix can be measured by assessing cell responses on a controlled series of thin and elastic gels that are affixed to a rigid substrate. Gel elasticity E is readily varied with polymer concentrations of now-standard polyacrylamide hydrogels, but to eliminate wrinkling and detachment of thin gels from an underlying glass coverslip, vinyl groups are bonded to the glass before polymerization. Gel thickness is nominally specified using micron-scale beads that act as spacers, but gels swell after polymerization as measured by z-section, confocal microscopy of fluorescent gels. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to measure E at gel surfaces, employing stresses and strains that are typically generated by cells and yielding values for E that span a broad range of tissue microenvironments. To illustrate cell sensitivities to a series of thin-to-thick gels, the adhesive spreading of mesenchymal stem cells was measured on gel mimics of a very soft tissue (eg. brain, E \~{} 1 kPa). Initial results show that cells increasingly respond to the rigidity of an underlying 'hidden' surface starting at about 10-20 microm gel thickness with a characteristic tactile length of less than about 5 microm.},

abstract = {Blood flow behaves differently at the microvascular level than they do at upper levels of circulating systems. The endothelial glycocalyx layer on the luminal surface of blood vessels plays a significant role in regulating blood flow and blood cell movement in microvascular networks. For instance, previous experimental studies showed that the endothelial glycocalyx layer causes additional resistance to blood flow in small blood vessels. One of the important facts of the endothelial glycocalyx layer is that this layer is highly negatively charged. The question remains: do these electrostatic charges retard blood flow in small blood vessels according to the electroviscous effect? Here, a theoretical model is proposed to investigate the electrochemical effects of the endothelial glycocalyx layer on two-phase non-Newtonian blood flow in small blood vessels. Results show that electrostatic charges on the endothelial glycocalyx layer induce negligible effect to blood flow. Therefore, we can attribute the cause of additional resistance by the endothelial glycocalyx layer mainly to other mechanisms, such as, the glycocalyx constituted proteins acting as a flow barrier.},

@article{Rikitake2005,
abstract = {The lipid-lowering drugs, 3-hydroxy-3-methylgulutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or statins, are used in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Recent experimental and clinical studies suggest that statins may exert vascular protective effects beyond cholesterol reduction. For example, statins improve endothelial function by cholesterol-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The cholesterol-independent or "pleiotropic" effects of statins include the upregulation and activation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Because statins inhibit an early step in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, they also inhibit the synthesis of isoprenoids such as farnesylpyrophosphate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, which are important posttranslational lipid attachments for intracellular signaling molecules such as the Rho GTPases. Indeed, decrease in Rho GTPase responses as a consequence of statin treatment increases the production and bioavailability of endothelium-derived NO. The mechanism involves, in part, Rho/Rho-kinase (ROCK)-mediated changes in the actin cytoskeleton, which leads to decreases in eNOS mRNA stability. The regulation of eNOS by Rho GTPases, therefore, may be an important mechanism underlying the cardiovascular protective effect of statins.},

@article{Dai1995,
abstract = {Many cell phenomena involve major morphological changes, particularly in mitosis and the process of cell migration. For cells or neuronal growth cones to migrate, they must extend the leading edge of the plasma membrane as a lamellipodium or filopodium. During extension of filopodia, membrane must move across the surface creating shear and flow. Intracellular biochemical processes driving extension must work against the membrane mechanical properties, but the forces required to extend growth cones have not been measured. In this paper, laser optical tweezers and a nanometer-level analysis system were used to measure the neuronal growth cone membrane mechanical properties through the extension of filopodia-like tethers with IgG-coated beads. Although the probability of a bead attaching to the membrane was constant irrespective of treatment; the probability of forming a tether with a constant force increased dramatically with cytochalasin B or D and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). These are treatments that alter the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. The force required to hold a tether at zero velocity (F0) was greater than forces generated by single molecular motors, kinesin and myosin; and F0 decreased with cytochalasin B or D and DMSO in correlation with the changes in the probability of tether formation. The force of the tether on the bead increased linearly with the velocity of tether elongation. From the dependency of tether force on velocity of tether formation, we calculated a parameter related to membrane viscosity, which decreased with cytochalasin B or D, ATP depletion, nocodazole, and DMSO. These results indicate that the actin cytoskeleton affects the membrane mechanical properties, including the force required for membrane extension and the viscoelastic behavior.},

@article{Ioannidis2007,
abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

However, data from experimental and animal studies strongly support that dysregulated redox signaling, resulting from hyperactivation of various cellular oxidases or mitochondrial dysfunction, is integral to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this review, we address how redox signaling modulates the protein function, the various sources of increased oxidative stress in CVD, and the labyrinth of redox-sensitive molecular mechanisms involved in the development of atherosclerosis, hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Advances in redox biology and pharmacology for inhibiting ROS production in specific cell types and subcellular organelles combined with the development of nanotechnology-based new in vivo imaging systems and targeted drug delivery mechanisms may enable fine-tuning of redox signaling for the treatment and prevention of CVD.},

The BC3726 line originates from the HCV29 cell line which was transformed by the v-ras oncogene. To evaluate their elastic properties, Young's modulus values were determined. The present study has shown that normal cells have a Young's modulus of about one order of magnitude higher than cancerous ones. Such a change might be attributed to a difference in the organisation of cell cytoskeletons and requires further studies.},

@article{Korte2012a,
abstract = {Plasma sodium, slightly above normal and in presence of aldosterone, stiffens vascular endothelium and reduces nitric oxide release with the consequence of endothelial dysfunction. This process is mediated by epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) and, most likely, the endothelial Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. Both, ENaC and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, are located in the plasma membrane of endothelial cells and embedded in the endothelial glycocalyx (eGC). This negatively charged biopolymer is directly exposed to the blood stream and selectively buffers sodium ions. We hypothesize that the glycocalyx could interfere with endothelial sodium transport when extracellular sodium varies in the physiological range. Therefore, we modeled the endothelial cell as a pump-leak system measuring changes of intracellular sodium in cultured human endothelial cells. Experiments were performed under low/high extracellular sodium conditions before and after enzymatic eGC removal, and with inhibition of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and ENaC, respectively. Three major observations were made: (1) eGC removal by heparinase treatment facilitates sodium to enter/exit the endothelial cells. (2) The direction of net sodium movement across the endothelial plasma membrane depends on the concentration of extracellular sodium which regulates both the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and ENaC activity. (3) Removal of eGC and inhibition of sodium transport modify the electrical resistance of endothelial cells. We conclude that the eGC serves as a potential "firewall" preventing uncontrolled access of sodium to the pump-leak system of the endothelial cell. After eGC removal, sodium access to the system is facilitated. Thus the pump-leak system could be regulated by ambient sodium and control vascular permeability in pathophysiological conditions.},

abstract = {Ischemia (I)/reperfusion (RP)-induced endothelial cell (EC) injury is thought to be due to mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production. MtROS have been implicated in mitochondrial fission. We determined whether cultured EC exposure to simulated I/RP causes morphological changes in the mitochondrial network and the mechanisms behind those changes. Because shear stress results in nitric oxide (NO)-mediated endothelial mtROS generation, we simulated I/RP as hypoxia (H) followed by oxygenated flow over the ECs (shear stress of 10dyn/cm(2)). By exposing ECs to shear stress, H, H/reoxygenation (RO), or simulated I/RP and employing MitoTracker staining, we assessed the differential effects of changes in mechanical forces and/or O(2) levels on the mitochondrial network. Static or sheared ECs maintained their mitochondrial network. H- or H/RO-exposed ECs underwent changes, but mitochondrial fission was significantly less compared to that in ECs exposed to I/RP. I/RP-induced fission was partially inhibited by antioxidants, a NO synthase inhibitor, or an inhibitor of the fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and was accompanied by Drp1 oligomerization and phosphorylation (Ser616). Hence, shear-induced NO, ROS (including mtROS), and Drp1 activation are responsible for mitochondrial fission in I/RP-exposed ECs, and excessive fission may be an underlying cause of EC dysfunction in postischemic hearts.},

abstract = {A simple Ar(+)-ion irradiation route has been developed to prepare gold nanoneedle arrays on glass substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-active substrates. The nanoneedles exhibited very sharp tips with an apex diameter of 20 nm. These arrays were evaluated as potential SERS substrates using malachite green molecules and exhibited a SERS enhancement factor of greater than 10(8), which is attributed to the localized electron field enhancement around the apex of the needle and the surface plasmon coupling originating from the periodic structure. This work demonstrates a new technique for producing controllable and reproducible SERS substrates potentially applicable for chemical and biological assays.},

abstract = {Here we present experimental evidence that phagocytic cells use modulation of specific components of their glycocalyx to regulate their binding capacity. Particles coated with antibodies specific for the CD32 medium affinity IgG receptor were driven along human monocytic THP-1 cells (expressing CD32) in a flow chamber operated at low shear rate. Surprisingly, only minimal adhesion was observed. However, when cells were activated by exposure to fibronectin-coated surfaces and/or soluble \&ggr; interferon, adhesion efficiency was dramatically increased, whereas the apparent glycocalyx thickness displayed 20\% decrease, and the surface density of CD43/leukosialin carbohydrate epitopes displayed 30-40\% decrease on activated cells. The existence of a causal link between adhesion increase and glycocalyx alteration was strongly supported by the finding that (i) both phenomena displayed similar kinetics, (ii) an inverse relationship between THP-1 cell binding capacity and glycocalyx density was demonstrated at the individual cell level, and (iii) adhesion enhancement could not be ascribed to an increased binding site density or improved functional capacity of activated cells. Additional experiments revealed that cell-to-particle adhesion resulted in delayed (i.e. more than a few minutes) egress of CD43/leukosialin from contact areas. Since the time scale of particle attachment was less than a second, surface mobility should not affect the potential of CD43 to impair the initial step of adhesion. Finally, studies performed with fluorescent lectins suggested that THP-1 cell activation and increased adhesive potential were related to a decrease of O-glysosylation rather than N-glycosylation of surface glycoproteins.},

abstract = {There are many challenges in accomplishing tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) and obtaining a proper tip is probably the greatest one. Since tip size, composition, and geometry are the ultimate parameters that determine enhancement of intensity and lateral resolution, the tip becomes the most critical component in a TERS experiment. However, since the discovery of TERS the cantilevers used in atomic force microscopy (AFM) have remained basically the same: commercial silicon (or silicon nitride) tips covered by a metallic coating. The main issues of using metal-coated silicon cantilevers, such as wearing off of the metal layer or increased tip radius, can be completely overcome by using all-metal cantilevers. Until now in TERS experiments such probes have only been used in a scanning tunneling microscope or in a tuning fork-based shear force microscope but not in AFM. In this work for the first time, we show the use of compact silver cantilevers that are fully compatible with contact and tapping modes in AFM demonstrating their superb performance in TERS experiments.},

abstract = {The endothelium is considered to be relatively independent of the mitochondrial energy supply. The goals of this study were to examine mitochondrial respiratory functions in endothelial cells and isolated mitochondria and to assess the influence of chronic high glucose exposure on the aerobic metabolism of these cells. A procedure to isolate of bioenergetically active endothelial mitochondria was elaborated. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EA.hy926 line) were grown in medium containing either 5.5 or 25 mM glucose. The respiratory response to elevated glucose was observed in cells grown in 25 mM glucose for at least 6 days or longer. In EA.hy926 cells, growth in high glucose induced considerably lower mitochondrial respiration with glycolytic fuels, less pronounced with glutamine, and higher respiration with palmitate. The Crabtree effect was observed in both types of cells. High glucose conditions produced elevated levels of cellular Q10, increased ROS generation, increased hexokinase I, lactate dehydrogenase, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), and superoxide dismutase 2 expression, and decreased E3-binding protein of pyruvate dehydrogenase expression. In isolated mitochondria, hyperglycaemia induced an increase in the oxidation of palmitoylcarnitine and glycerol-3-phosphate (lipid-derived fuels) and a decrease in the oxidation of pyruvate (a mitochondrial fuel); in addition, increased UCP2 activity was observed. Our results demonstrate that primarily glycolytic endothelial cells possess highly active mitochondria with a functioning energy-dissipating pathway (UCP2). High-glucose exposure induces a shift of the endothelial aerobic metabolism towards the oxidation of lipids and amino acids.},

abstract = {Actin filament remodeling regulates several endothelial cell (EC) processes such as contraction, migration, adhesion, and shape determination. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2)-mediated phosphorylation of heat-shock protein 27 kDa (HSP27) promotes actin filament remodeling, but little is known about the regulation of this event in ECs. We found that tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$) SUMOylated MK2 at lysine (K)-339 affected EC actin filament organization and migration. Loss of the MK2 SUMOylation site (MK2-K339R) increased MK2 kinase activity and prolonged HSP27 phosphorylation, enhancing its effects on actin filament-dependent events. Both TNF-$\alpha$-mediated EC elongation and steady laminar shear stress-mediated EC alignment were increased by MK2-K339R. Moreover, kinase-dead dominant-negative MK2 (DN-MK2) inhibited these effects. Cell migration is a dynamic process regulated by actin filament remodeling. Both wild-type MK2 (WT-MK2) and DN-MK2 significantly enhanced TNF-mediated inhibition of EC migration, and MK2-K339R further augmented this effect. Interestingly, the p160-Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 reversed this effect by MK2-K339R, which strongly suggests that both excessive and insufficient levels of actin filament remodeling can block EC migration. Our study shows that MK2 SUMOylation is a new mechanism for regulating actin filament dynamics in ECs.},

abstract = {A demanding task of medicine is to understand and control the immune system. Central players in the cellular immune response are the leukocytes that leave the blood stream for host defense. Endothelial cells limit the emigration rate of leukocytes. Being located between blood and tissues, they permit or deny the passage. The exact mechanism of this process called diapedesis is not solved yet. Leukocytes can principally traverse either between cells (paracellularly) or directly through an individual endothelial cell (transcellularly). The transcellular way has recently gained experimental support, but it is not clear how the endothelial cytoskeleton manages to open and close a transmigratory channel. Atomic force microscopy was used to investigate the endothelial cytoskeleton. In order to directly access the leukocyte-endothelial interaction site, we applied a special protocol ("nanosurgery"). As a result, the endothelial cell turned out to become softer in a confined region strictly underneath the leukocyte. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed a depolymerization of the f-actin strands at the invasion site. Leukocytes dramatically rearrange the endothelial cytoskeleton to form transmigratory channels.},

abstract = {We investigated physicochemical properties of two types of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PIPAAm)-grafted tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) surfaces, to elucidate the influential factors for thermally regulated cell adhesion and detachment to PIPAAm-grafted surfaces. The two types of PIPAAm-grafted surfaces were prepared by the electron beam polymerization method. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that amounts of the grafted polymers were 1.4 +/- 0.1 microg/cm2 for PIPAAm-1.4 and 2.9 +/- 0.1 microg/cm2 for PIPAAm-2.9. Both PIPAAm-grafted surfaces showed hydrophobic/hydrophilic property alterations in response to temperature. However, PIPAAm-1.4 surfaces were more hydrophobic (cos theta = 0.21 at 37 degrees C and cos theta = 0.35 at 20 degrees C) than PIPAAm-2.9 (cos theta = 0.42 at 37 degrees C and cos theta = 0.50 at 20 degrees C) both above and below the PIPAAm's transition temperature. Thicknesses of the grafted PIPAAm layers were estimated to be 15.5 +/- 7.2 nm for PIPAAm-1.4 and 29.5 +/- 8.4 nm for PIPAAm-2.9, by the use of UV excimer laser and atomic force microscope. Bovine carotid artery endothelial cells (ECs) adhere to the surfaces of PIPAAm-1.4 and proliferate to form confluent cell monolayers. The cell monolayers were harvested as single cell sheets by temperature decrease from 37 to 20 degrees C. On the contrary, ECs did not adhere to the surfaces of PIPAAm-2.9. This phenomenon was correlated with an adsorption of cell adhesion protein, fibronectin, onto surfaces ofPIPAAm-1.4 and -2.9. In the case of nano-ordered thin grafted surfaces, the surface chain mobility is strongly influenced by the thickness of PIPAAm grafted layers because dehydration of PIPAAm chains should be enhanced by the hydrophobic TCPS surfaces. PIPAAm graft amounts, that is, thickness of the PIPAAm grafted layers, play a crucial role in temperature-induced hydrophilic/hydrophobic property alterations and cell adhesion/detachment behavior.},

abstract = {The mechanical properties of a cell are defined mainly by the cytoskeleton. One contributor within this three-dimensional structure is the actin cortex which is located underneath the lipid bilayer. It forms a nearly isotropic and densely cross-linked protein network. We present a continuum mechanical formulation for describing the mechanical properties of in vitro model systems based on their micro-structure, i.e. the behavior of a single filament and its spatial arrangement. The network is considered elastic, viscous effects being neglected. Filamentous actin is a biopolymer with a highly nonlinear force-stretch relationship. This can be well described by a worm-like chain model that includes extensibility of the filament, which we call the $\beta$-model. A comparison with experimental data shows good agreement with values for the physically interpretable parameters. To make these properties applicable to three dimensions we used a non-affine micro-sphere network, which accounts for filaments, equally distributed in space. The assembled model results in a strain-energy density which is a function of the deformation gradient, and it is validated with experimental data from rheological experiments of in vitro reconstituted actin networks. The Cauchy stress and elasticity tensors are obtained within the continuum mechanics framework and implemented into a finite element program to solve boundary-value problems.},

The nonionic detergent Triton X-100 in a low concentration was used to remove the membrane, soluble proteins, and organelles from the cell. The remaining cytoskeleton can then be directly visualized in either liquid or air-dried ambient conditions. These two types of scanning provide complimentary information. Scanning in liquid visualizes the surface filaments of the cytoskeleton, whereas scanning in air shows both the surface filaments and the total "volume" of the cytoskeletal fibers. The smallest fibers observed were ca. 50 nm in diameter. The lateral resolution of this technique was ca.20 nm, which can be increased to a single nanometer level by choosing sharper AFM tips. Because the AFM is a true 3D technique, we are able to quantify the observed cytoskeleton by its density and volume. The types of fibers can be identified by their size, similar to electron microscopy.},

abstract = {In the present study, the association of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) with the actin cytoskeleton in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) was examined. We found that the protein contents of eNOS, actin, and caveolin-1 were significantly higher in the caveolar fraction of plasma membranes than in the noncaveolar fraction of plasma membranes in PAEC. Immunoprecipitation of eNOS from lysates of caveolar fractions of plasma membranes in PAEC resulted in the coprecipitation of actin, and immunoprecipitation of actin from lysates of caveolar fractions resulted in the coprecipitation of eNOS. Confocal microscopy of PAEC, in which eNOS was labeled with fluorescein, F-actin was labeled with Texas red-phalloidin, and G-actin was labeled with deoxyribonuclease I conjugated with Texas red, also demonstrated an association between eNOS and F-actin or G-actin. Incubation of purified eNOS with purified F-actin and G-actin resulted in an increase in eNOS activity. The increase in eNOS activity caused by G-actin was much higher than that caused by F-actin. Incubation of PAEC with swinholide A, an actin filament disruptor, resulted in an increase in eNOS activity, eNOS protein content, and association of eNOS with G-actin and in a decrease in the association of eNOS with F-actin. The increase in eNOS activity was higher than that in eNOS protein content in swinholide A-treated cells. In contrast, exposure of PAEC to phalloidin, an actin filament stabilizer, caused decreases in eNOS activity and association of eNOS with G-actin and increases in association of eNOS with F-actin. These results suggest that eNOS is associated with actin in PAEC and that actin and its polymerization state play an important role in the regulation of eNOS activity.},

abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease and oxidative stress plays an important role in this process. Therefore, we investigated the effects of hyperglycemia on the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide/cGMP signaling in two different endothelial cell cultures. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and EA.hy 926 cells showed increased oxidative stress and impaired NO-cGMP signaling in response to hyperglycemia. The major difference between the two different cell types was the dramatic decrease in viability in HUVEC whereas EA.hy cells showed rather increased growth under hyperglycemic conditions.

abstract = {The endothelium has an important role in controlling the extravasation of leukocytes from blood to tissues. Endothelial permeability for leukocytes is influenced by transmembrane proteins that control inter-endothelial adhesion, as well as steps of the leukocyte transmigration process. In a cascade consisting of leukocyte rolling, adhesion, firm adhesion, and diapedesis, a new step was recently introduced, the formation of a docking structure or "transmigratory cup." Both terms describe a structure formed by endothelial pseudopods embracing the leukocyte. It has been found associated with both para- and transcellular diapedesis. The aim of this study was to characterize the leukocyte-endothelial contact area in terms of morphology and cell mechanics to investigate how the endothelial cytoskeleton reorganizes to engulf the leukocyte. We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to selectively remove the leukocyte and then analyze the underlying cell at this specific spot. Firmly attached leukocytes could be removed by AFM nanomanipulation. In few cases, this exposed 8-12 microm wide and 1 microm deep footprints, representing the cup-like docking structure. Some of them were located near endothelial cell junctions. The interaction area did not exhibit significant alterations neither morphologically nor mechanically as compared to the surrounding cell surface. In conclusion, the endothelial invagination is formed without a net depolymerization of f-actin, as endothelial softening at the site of adhesion does not seem to be involved. Moreover, there were no cases of phagocytotic engulfment, but instead the formation of a transmigratory channel could be observed.},

Due to its ability to provide chemical and topographic characterization in a single experiment at a sub-100 nm resolution, TERS has gained importance in super-resolution structural analysis. In this contribution the focus is set on applications with relevance in the biology and medical fields. The potential and challenges of this near-field technique are discussed with respect to state-of-the-art microscopic and spectroscopic imaging methods.

abstract = {Acrylamide, a known disrupter of intermediate filaments, has been used to produce the collapse of vimentin filaments in bovine lens epithelial (BEL) cells, and its potential modulation of staurosporine-induced apoptosis has been investigated. In BEL cells, short treatments with acrylamide caused the collapse of vimentin filaments and microtubules and the almost complete disappearance of stress fibers, with thick f-actin bundles remaining in the cell periphery. Actin organization was less affected in cells pretreated with colchicine and in spreading cells, suggesting that extended microtubules and vimentin filaments are required for acrylamide to produce its maximal effects. Acrylamide alone slightly increased apoptosis compared to controls. However, simultaneous exposure to acrylamide and staurosporine for 8h produced significantly less apoptosis than staurosporine alone, and preincubation with acrylamide followed by staurosporine markedly reduced apoptosis at 8 and 24h of treatment. Acrylamide seems therefore to have a dual effect on BEL cell survival.},

abstract = {1-methylnicotinamide (MNA) displays anti-inflammatory effects in patients with contact dermatitis, though the mechanisms involved remain unknown. Herein, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of MNA and its parent molecule, nicotinamide, in the contact hypersensitivity reaction to oxazolone in CBA/J inbred mice. Feeding mice with MNA or nicotinamide (100 mg/kg, 10 days) resulted in the inhibition of the development of contact hypersensitivity reaction by 37\% and 35\%, respectively, as assessed by the magnitude of ear swelling. This effect was not associated with changes in the expression of adhesion molecules (CD49d(+) and CD54(+)) on CD4(+) and CD8(+) oxazolone-specific T lymphocytes, the major cell component of an inflammatory infiltrate in contact hypersensitivity reaction. Furthermore, in the adoptive transfer model of contact hypersensitivity reaction, pretreatment of mice (recipients of oxazolone-specific T cells), with MNA, resulted in a remarkable anti-inflammatory effect (inhibition of contact hypersensitivity reaction by 66\%). Interestingly, in the presence of prostanoid IP receptor antagonist R-3-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-2-[5-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-benzofuran-2-ylmethoxycarbonylamino]-propionic acid (RO-3244794) (10 mg/kg) the MNA was inactive. In summary, pretreatment with MNA profoundly attenuated contact hypersensitivity reaction in vivo. In particular, the vessel dependent phase of contact hypersensitivity reaction was affected, in spite of the fact that MNA did not alter the expression of adhesive molecules on oxazolone-specific T lymphocytes. However, the anti-inflammatory action of MNA was completely reversed by the antagonist of prostanoid IP receptor. Accordingly, our results demonstrate for the first time that anti-inflammatory properties of MNA are linked to endothelial, PGI(2)-mediated mechanisms.},

@article{Shen2010,
abstract = {Microvascular barrier dysfunction is implicated in the initiation and progression of inflammation, posttraumatic complications, sepsis, ischaemia-reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. Under physiological conditions, a precise equilibrium between endothelial cell-cell adhesion and actin-myosin-based centripetal tension tightly controls the semi-permeability of microvascular barriers. Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) plays an important role in maintaining the equilibrium by phosphorylating myosin light chain (MLC), thereby inducing actomyosin contractility and weakening endothelial cell-cell adhesion. MLCK is activated by numerous physiological factors and inflammatory or angiogenic mediators, causing vascular hyperpermeability. In this review, we discuss experimental evidence supporting the crucial role of MLCK in the hyperpermeability response to key cell signalling events during inflammation. At the cellular level, in vitro studies of cultured endothelial monolayers treated with MLCK inhibitors or transfected with specific inhibiting peptides have demonstrated that induction of endothelial MLCK activity is necessary for hyperpermeability. Ex vivo studies of live microvessels, enabled by development of the isolated, perfused venule method, support the importance of MLCK in endothelial permeability regulation in an environment that more closely resembles in vivo tissues. Finally, the role of MLCK in vascular hyperpermeability has been confirmed with in vivo studies of animal disease models and the use of transgenic MLCK210 knockout mice. These approaches provide a more complete view of the role of MLCK in vascular barrier dysfunction.},

abstract = {In the present study, the association of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) with the actin cytoskeleton in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) was examined. We found that the protein contents of eNOS, actin, and caveolin-1 were significantly higher in the caveolar fraction of plasma membranes than in the noncaveolar fraction of plasma membranes in PAEC. Immunoprecipitation of eNOS from lysates of caveolar fractions of plasma membranes in PAEC resulted in the coprecipitation of actin, and immunoprecipitation of actin from lysates of caveolar fractions resulted in the coprecipitation of eNOS. Confocal microscopy of PAEC, in which eNOS was labeled with fluorescein, F-actin was labeled with Texas red-phalloidin, and G-actin was labeled with deoxyribonuclease I conjugated with Texas red, also demonstrated an association between eNOS and F-actin or G-actin. Incubation of purified eNOS with purified F-actin and G-actin resulted in an increase in eNOS activity. The increase in eNOS activity caused by G-actin was much higher than that caused by F-actin. Incubation of PAEC with swinholide A, an actin filament disruptor, resulted in an increase in eNOS activity, eNOS protein content, and association of eNOS with G-actin and in a decrease in the association of eNOS with F-actin. The increase in eNOS activity was higher than that in eNOS protein content in swinholide A-treated cells. In contrast, exposure of PAEC to phalloidin, an actin filament stabilizer, caused decreases in eNOS activity and association of eNOS with G-actin and increases in association of eNOS with F-actin. These results suggest that eNOS is associated with actin in PAEC and that actin and its polymerization state play an important role in the regulation of eNOS activity.},

abstract = {Schlemm's canal (SC) endothelial cells are likely important in the physiology and pathophysiology of the aqueous drainage system of the eye, particularly in glaucoma. The mechanical stiffness of these cells determines, in part, the extent to which they can support a pressure gradient and thus can be used to place limits on the flow resistance that this layer can generate in the eye. However, little is known about the biomechanical properties of SC endothelial cells. Our goal in this study was to estimate the effective Young's modulus of elasticity of normal SC cells. To do so, we combined magnetic pulling cytometry of isolated cultured human SC cells with finite element modeling of the mechanical response of the cell to traction forces applied by adherent beads. Preliminary work showed that the immersion angles of beads attached to the SC cells had a major influence on bead response; therefore, we also measured bead immersion angle by confocal microscopy, using an empirical technique to correct for axial distortion of the confocal images. Our results showed that the upper bound for the effective Young's modulus of elasticity of the cultured SC cells examined in this study, in central, non-nuclear regions, ranged between 1,007 and 3,053 Pa, which is similar to, although somewhat larger than values that have been measured for other endothelial cell types. We compared these values to estimates of the modulus of primate SC cells in vivo, based on images of these cells under pressure loading, and found good agreement at low intraocular pressure (8-15 mm Hg). However, increasing intraocular pressure (22-30 mm Hg) appeared to cause a significant increase in the modulus of these cells. These moduli can be used to estimate the extent to which SC cells deform in response to the pressure drop across the inner wall endothelium and thereby estimate the extent to which they can generate outflow resistance.},

The reversibility of these observations by the addition of calcium ions, and other parallel experiments, support the conclusion that, in these cells, calcium is bound to anionic sites at the cell periphery, some of which are located at the cellular electrokinetic surface. These cells should, therefore, exhibit demonstrable calcium-sensitive aggregation, if current theories on the role of calcium in the physiological situation are correct. The fact that no calcium-sensitive aggregation was observed suggests that calcium does not form "bridges" between the adjacent anionic sites on different cells, and does not act directly by its effects on the diffuse electrical double-layer in this situation. An alternative hypothesis is advanced for the role played by calcium in cell adhesion and separation processes.},

Red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) induced free radical species (ROS) production at 12-24 h post-infection (pi; early replication stage) in fish GF-1 cells, and then at middle replication stage (24-48 h pi), this ROS signal may upregulate some expressions of the anti-oxidant enzymes Cu/Zn SOD and catalase, and eventually expression of the transcription factor Nrf2. Furthermore, both antioxidants diphenyliodonium and N-acetylcysteine or overexpression of zebrafish catalase in GF-1 cells also reduced ROS production and protected cells for enhancing host survival rate due to RGNNV infection. Furthermore, localization of ROS production using esterase activity and Mitotracker staining assays found that the ROS generated can affect mitochondrial morphology changes and causes $\Delta$$\Psi$ loss, both of which can be reversed by antioxidant treatment. Taken together, our data suggest that RGNNV induced oxidative stress response for playing dual role that can initiate the host oxidative stress defense system to upregulate expression of antioxidant enzymes and induces cell death via disrupting the mitochondrial morphology and inducing $\Delta$$\Psi$ loss, which can be reversed by anti-oxidants and zfcatalase, which provide new insight into betanodavirus-induced ROS-mediated pathogenesis.},

abstract = {A major structural component of the cell is the actin cytoskeleton, in which actin subunits are polymerised into actin filaments. These networks can be cross-linked by various types of ABPs (Actin Binding Proteins), such as Filamin A. In this paper, the passive response of cross-linked actin filament networks is evaluated, by use of a numerical and continuum network model. For the numerical model, the influence of filament length, statistical dispersion, cross-link compliance (including that representative of Filamin A) and boundary conditions on the mechanical response is evaluated and compared to experimental results. It is found that the introduction of statistical dispersion of filament lengths has a significant influence on the computed results, reducing the network stiffness by several orders of magnitude. Actin networks have previously been shown to have a characteristic transition from an initial bending-dominated to a stretching-dominated regime at larger strains, and the cross-link compliance is shown to shift this transition. The continuum network model, a modified eight-chain polymer model, is evaluated and shown to predict experimental results reasonably well, although a single set of parameters cannot be found to predict the characteristic dependence of filament length for different types of cross-links. Given the vast diversity of cross-linking proteins, the dependence of mechanical response on cross-link compliance signifies the importance of incorporating it properly in models to understand the roles of different types of actin networks and their respective tasks in the cell.},

abstract = {The mitochondrial network is dynamic with conformations that vary between a tubular continuum and a fragmented state. The equilibrium between mitochondrial fusion/fission, as well as the organelle motility, determine network morphology and ultimately mitochondrial/cell function. Network morphology has been linked with the energy state in different cell types. In this study, we examined how bioenergetic factors affect mitochondrial dynamics/motility in cultured vascular endothelial cells (ECs). ECs were transduced with mitochondria-targeted green fluorescent protein (mito-GFP) and exposed to inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) or ATP synthesis. Time-lapse fluorescence videos were acquired and a mathematical program that calculates size and speed of each mitochondrial object at each time frame was developed. Our data showed that inner mitochondrial membrane potential ($\Delta$$\Psi$(m)), ATP produced by glycolysis, and, to a lesser degree, ATP produced by mitochondria are critical for maintaining the mitochondrial network, and different metabolic stresses induce distinct morphological patterns (e.g., mitochondrial depolarization is necessary for "donut" formation). Mitochondrial movement, characterized by Brownian diffusion with occasional bursts in displacement magnitude, was inhibited under the same conditions that resulted in increased fission. Hence, imaging/mathematical analysis shed light on the relationship between bioenergetics and mitochondrial network morphology; the latter may determine EC survival under metabolic stress.},

@article{Heumuller2008,
abstract = {A large body of literature suggest that vascular reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases are important sources of reactive oxygen species. Many studies, however, relied on data obtained with the inhibitor apocynin (4'-hydroxy-3'methoxyacetophenone). Because the mode of action of apocynin, however, is elusive, we determined its mechanism of inhibition on vascular NADPH oxidases. In HEK293 cells overexpressing NADPH oxidase isoforms (Nox1, Nox2, or Nox4), apocynin failed to inhibit superoxide anion generation detected by lucigenin chemiluminescence. In contrast, apocynin interfered with the detection of reactive oxygen species in assay systems selective for hydrogen peroxide or hydroxyl radicals. Importantly, apocynin interfered directly with the detection of peroxides but not superoxide, if generated by xanthine/xanthine oxidase or nonenzymatic systems. In leukocytes, apocynin is a prodrug that is activated by myeloperoxidase, a process that results in the formation of apocynin dimers. Endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells failed to form these dimers and, therefore, are not able to activate apocynin. Dimer formation was, however, observed in Nox-overexpressing HEK293 cells when myeloperoxidase was supplemented. As a consequence, apocynin should only inhibit NADPH oxidase in leukocytes, whereas in vascular cells, the compound could act as an antioxidant. Indeed, in vascular smooth muscle cells, the activation of the redox-sensitive kinases p38-mitogen-activate protein kinase, Akt, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 by hydrogen peroxide and by the intracellular radical generator menadione was prevented in the presence of apocynin. These observations indicate that apocynin predominantly acts as an antioxidant in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells and should not be used as an NADPH oxidase inhibitor in vascular systems.},

abstract = {Activated rhoA, a ras-related GTP-binding protein, stimulates the appearance of stress fibers, focal adhesions, and tyrosine phosphorylation in quiescent cells (Ridley, A.J., and A. Hall, 1992. Cell. 70:389-399). The pathway by which rho triggers these events has not been elucidated. Many of the agents that activate rho (e.g., vasopressin, endothelin, lysophosphatidic acid) stimulate the contractility of smooth muscle and other cells. We have investigated whether rho's induction of stress fibers, focal adhesions, and tyrosine phosphorylation is the result of its stimulation of contractility. We demonstrate that stimulation of fibroblasts with lysophosphatidic acid, which activates rho, induces myosin light chain phosphorylation. This precedes the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions and is accompanied by increased contractility. Inhibition of contractility by several different mechanisms leads to inhibition of rho-induced stress fibers, focal adhesions, and tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, when contractility is inhibited, integrins disperse from focal adhesions as stress fibers and focal adhesions disassemble. Conversely, upon stimulation of contractility, diffusely distributed integrins are aggregated into focal adhesions. These results suggest that activated rho stimulates contractility, driving the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions and elevating tyrosine phosphorylation. A model is proposed to account for how contractility could promote these events.},

abstract = {Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising apoptotic agent that can selectively act on tumor cells. However, some cancer cells are resistant to TRAIL mediated apoptosis. In specific type of cells, sensitization by chemotherapeutic drugs may overcome the resistance to TRAIL induced apoptosis. In this work, atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation spectroscopy combined with fluorescence methods were used to investigate the biomechanical aspects of the resistance and unblocking of apoptosis in larynx carcinoma HEp2 cells treated with TRAIL. It is shown that there is a direct correlation between the increase in mechanical cell stiffness and the inhibition of apoptosis induced by TRAIL in HEp2 cells. Conversely, unblocking of apoptosis by sensitization of HEp2 cells with a chemotherapeutic drug Actinomycin D is related to the depolymerization of F-actin and to the decrease in the cell stiffness. Both effects, that is, changes in the mechanical stiffness of the cell and the inhibition of apoptotic pathway, are closely related to the Bcl-2 activity. Most probably, the depolymerization of F-actin results from downregulation of Rho protein, which in turn is accompanied by a lower activity of Bcl-2 and in consequence releases the intrinsic apoptotic channel. The presented results reveal a promising application of nanoindentation spectroscopy with an AFM tip as a novel tool for monitoring the processes of apoptosis inhibition.

abstract = {Originally identified in cultured cells, oncogenic cellular senescence is a growth-arrest mechanism which may inhibit tumor development by limiting the ability of cells to divide. However, literature shows that these cells secrete tumor-inducing and tumor-suppressing proteins leading to poor prognosis. Understanding the progression of oncogenic cellular senescence and associated mechanisms provides important implications for improving tumorigenesis therapeutic treatments. Micro-Raman spectroscopic imaging has grown in popularity as an imaging technique compared to the standard imaging predecessors and can be attributed to its numerous benefits such as no sample perturbation and the provision of direct chemical information. Through the use of label-free micro-Raman spectroscopy, control and senescent cells were noninvasively imaged. Resulting spectral images were processed using chemometric techniques, and average nuclei spectra from each sample set were compared. In turn, changes in the -cis and -trans unsaturated lipid isomer content were found to differ among proliferating and senescent cells. This may lead to increased nuclear fluidity and may contribute to the inability of senescent cells to complete the cell cycle. In the tumor environment, this detected increase in nuclear envelope fluidity could lead to downstream gene expression modifications and increased nucleo-cytoplasmic RNA translocation. Understanding nuclear envelope fluidity could provide insight into secretory profiles of senescent cells and their role in carcinogenesis, meriting further investigation into novel therapeutic technique development for oncogenic cellular senescence.},

More generally, a molecular scale description of wetting and capillary condensation as it applies to nanoscale interfaces is clearly desirable, but remains an important challenge. The measurement of adhesion between self- assembled monolayers has proven to be a reliable way to probe the influence of surface chemistry and local environment on adhesion. To date, how- ever, few of these systems have been investigated in detail quantitatively. The molecular origins of adhesion down to the single-bond level still need to be fully investigated. The most recent studies illustrate that, while new information about ad- hesion in these systems has been revealed, further enhancements of current techniques as well as the development of new methodologies coupled with accurate theoretical modeling are required to adequately tackle these complex measurements.},

abstract = {The stiffness of vascular endothelial cells is crucial to mechanically withstand blood flow and, at the same time, to control deformation-dependent nitric oxide release. However, the regulation of mechanical stiffness is not yet understood. There is evidence that a possible regulator is the electrical plasma membrane potential difference. Using a novel technique that combines fluorescence-based membrane potential recordings with atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based stiffness measurements, the present study shows that membrane depolarization is associated with a decrease in the stiffness of endothelial cells. Three different depolarization protocols were applied, all of which led to a similar and significant decrease in cell stiffness, independently of changes in cell volume. Moreover, experiments using the actin-destabilizing agent cytochalasin D indicated that depolarization acts by affecting the cortical actin cytoskeleton. A model is proposed whereby a change of the electrical field across the plasma membrane is directly sensed by the submembranous actin network, regulating the actin polymerization:depolymerization ratio and thus cell stiffness. This depolarization-induced decrease in the stiffness of endothelial cells could play a role in flow-mediated nitric-oxide-dependent vasodilation.},

abstract = {Cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) plays an important role in endothelial cell signaling. Although it has been suggested that the influx of Ca2+ can be triggered by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, the mechanism (or mechanisms) underlying this phenomenon needs further elaboration. In the present study, involvement of myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) in the regulation of Ca2+ signaling was investigated in agonist- and fluid flow-stimulated endothelial cells loaded with Ca2+-sensitive dyes. Bradykinin (BK) and thapsigargin caused an increase in [Ca2+]i followed by a sustained rise due to Ca2+ influx from extracellular space and shifted total myosin light-chain (MLC) from the unphosphorylated to the diphosphorylated form. ML-9 (100 microM), an inhibitor of MLCK, abolished Ca2+ influx and prevented MLC diphosphorylation in BK- and thapsigargin-treated cells, but did not affect Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores. Fluid flow stimulation (shear stress=5 dynes/cm2) increased [Ca2+]i and enhanced MLC phosphorylation. ML-9 also inhibited Ca2+ response and MLC phosphorylation in fluid flow-stimulated cells. The Ca2+ influx in response to BK was linearly correlated with the diphosphorylation of MLC in ML-9 treated cells. Effects of ML-5 and ML-7, analogs of ML-9, to inhibit Ca2+ influx paralleled their potencies to inhibit MLCK activity. These findings demonstrate that MLCK plays an essential role in regulating the plasmalemmal Ca2+ influx in agonist- and fluid flow-stimulated endothelial cells. This study is the first to report the close relationship between Ca2+ influx and MLC diphosphorylation.},

This broadened concept can be designated as vascular memory. According to this new concept, not only immediate and short-term but long-term effects of the metabolic and cardiovascular risk milieu are of great importance. Consequently, early and intensive lifestyle interventions, treatment of hyperglycaemia, lipid abnormalities and hypertension can result in beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes even in the long run. On the contrary, failing in target-oriented treatment from early detection of abnormalities can be associated with life-threatening cardiovascular events subsequently. Additional experimental studies are needed to characterize the exact pathomechanism of vascular memory and further clinical trials are also essential to explore its real clinical significance.},

abstract = {Mechanical properties of protein crystals and aggregates depend on the conformational and structural properties of individual protein molecules as well as on the packing density and structure within solid materials. An atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based approach is developed to measure the elastic modulus of small protein crystals by nanoindentation and is applied to measure the elasticity of insulin crystals. The top face of the crystals deposited on mica substrates is identified as the (001) face. Insulin crystals exhibit a nearly elastic response during the compression cycle. The elastic modulus measured on the top face has asymmetric distribution with a significant width. This width is related to the uncertainty in the deflection sensitivity. A model that takes into account the distribution of the sensitivity values is used to correct the elastic modulus. Measurements performed in aqueous buffer on several crystals at different locations with three different AFM probes give a mean elastic modulus of 164 +/- 10 MPa. This value is close to the static elastic moduli of other protein crystals measured by different techniques that are usually measured in the range from 100 MPa to 1 GPa. The measured modulus of insulin crystals falls between the elastic modulus values of insulin amyloid fibrils measured previously at two orthogonal directions (a modulus of 14 MPa was measured by compressing the fibril in the direction perpendicular to the fibril axis, and a modulus of 3.3 GPa was measured in the direction along the fibril axis). This comparison indicates the heterogeneous structure of fibrils in the direction perpendicular to the fibril axis, with a packing density of the amyloid fibril core that is higher than the average packing density in insulin crystals. The mechanical wear of insulin crystals is detected during AFM measurements. In nanoindentation experiments on insulin crystal, the compressive load by the AFM tip ( approximately 1 nN, corresponding to a pressure of around 5 MPa) occasionally removes protein molecules from the top or the second top layer of insulin crystal in a sequential manner. The molecular model of this surface damage is proposed. In addition, the removal of the multiple layers of molecules is observed during the AC-mode imaging in aqueous buffer. The number of removed layers depends on the scan size.},

abstract = {Central to the biological function of microtubules is their ability to modify their length which occurs by addition and removal of subunits at the ends of the polymer, both in vivo and in vitro. This dynamic behavior is strongly influenced by temperature. Here, we show that the lateral interaction between tubulin subunits forming microtubule is strongly temperature dependent. Microtubules deposited on prefabricated substrates were deformed in an atomic force microscope during imaging, in two different experimental geometries. Microtubules were modeled as anisotropic, with the Young's modulus corresponding to the resistance of protofilaments to stretching and the shear modulus describing the weak interaction between the protofilaments. Measurements involving radial compression of microtubules deposited on flat mica confirm that microtubule elasticity depends on the temperature. Bending measurements performed on microtubules deposited on lithographically fabricated substrates show that this temperature dependence is due to changing shear modulus, implying that the lateral interaction between the protofilaments is strongly determined by the temperature. These measurements are in good agreement with previously reported measurements of the disassembly rate of microtubules, demonstrating that the mechanical and dynamic properties of microtubules are closely related.},

abstract = {Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) serves as a critical co-factor for the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS). A deficiency of BH4 results in eNOS uncoupling, which is associated with increased superoxide and decreased NO* production. BH4 has been suggested to be a target for oxidation by peroxynitrite (ONOO-), and ascorbate has been shown to preserve BH4 levels and enhance endothelial NO* production; however, the mechanisms underlying these processes remain poorly defined. To gain further insight into these interactions, the reaction of ONOO- with BH4 was studied using electron spin resonance and the spin probe 1-hydroxy-3-carboxy-2,2,5-tetramethyl-pyrrolidine. ONOO- reacted with BH4 6-10 times faster than with ascorbate or thiols. The immediate product of the reaction between ONOO- and BH4 was the trihydrobiopterin radical (BH3.), which was reduced back to BH4 by ascorbate, whereas thiols were not efficient in recycling of BH4. Uncoupling of eNOS caused by peroxynitrite was investigated in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) by measuring superoxide and NO* using spin probe 1-hydroxy-3-methoxycarbonyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-pyrrolidine and the NO*-spin trap iron-diethyldithiocarbamate. Bolus ONOO-, the ONOO- donor 3-morpholinosydnonimine, and an inhibitor of BH4 synthesis (2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine) uncoupled eNOS, increasing superoxide and decreasing NO* production. Exogenous BH4 supplementation restored endothelial NO* production. Treatment of BAECs with both BH4 and ascorbate prior to ONOO- prevented uncoupling of eNOS by ONOO-. This study demonstrates that endothelial BH4 is a crucial target for oxidation by ONOO- and that the BH4 reaction rate constant exceeds those of thiols or ascorbate. We confirmed that ONOO- uncouples eNOS by oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin and that ascorbate does not fully protect BH4 from oxidation but recycles BH3. radical back to BH4.},

@article{Bausch1998,
abstract = {A magnetic bead microrheometer has been designed which allows the generation of forces up to 10(4) pN on 4.5 micron paramagnetic beads. It is applied to measure local viscoelastic properties of the surface of adhering fibroblasts. Creep response and relaxation curves evoked by tangential force pulses of 500-2500 pN (and approximately 1 s duration) on the magnetic beads fixed to the integrin receptors of the cell membrane are recorded by particle tracking. Linear three-phasic creep responses consisting of an elastic deflection, a stress relaxation, and a viscous flow are established. The viscoelastic response curves are analyzed in terms of a series arrangement of a dashpot and a Voigt body, which allows characterization of the viscoelastic behavior of the adhering cell surface in terms of three parameters: an effective elastic constant, a viscosity, and a relaxation time. The displacement field generated by the local tangential forces on the cell surface is visualized by observing the induced motion of assemblies of nonmagnetic colloidal probes fixed to the membrane. It is found that the displacement field decays rapidly with the distance from the magnetic bead. A cutoff radius of Rc approximately 7 micron of the screened elastic field is established. Partial penetration of the shear field into the cytoplasm is established by observing the induced deflection of intracellular compartments. The cell membrane was modeled as a thin elastic plate of shear modulus mu * coupled to a viscoelastic layer, which is fixed to a solid support on the opposite side; the former accounts for the membrane/actin cortex, and the latter for the contribution of the cytoskeleton to the deformation of the cell envelope. It is characterized by the coupling constant chi characterizing the elasticity of the cytoskeleton. The coupling constant chi and the surface shear modulus mu * are obtained from the measured displacements of the magnetic and nonmagnetic beads. By analyzing the experimental data in terms of this model a surface shear modulus of mu * approximately 2 . 10(-3) Pa m to 4 . 10(-3) Pa m is found. By assuming an approximate plate thickness of 0.1 micron one estimates an average bulk shear modulus of mu approximately (2 / 4) . 10(-4) Pa, which is in reasonable agreement with data obtained by atomic force microscopy. The viscosity of the dashpot is related to the apparent viscosity of the cytoplasm, which is obtained by assuming that the top membrane is coupled to the bottom (fixed) membrane by a viscous medium. By application of the theory of diffusion of membrane proteins in supported membranes we find a coefficient of friction of bc approximately 2 . 10(9) Pa s/m corresponding to a cytoplasmic viscosity of 2 . 10(3) Pa s.},

@article{Thoelking2010,
abstract = {Inflammation and cellular fibrosis often imply an involvement of the cytokine TGF-beta1. TGF-beta1 induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT), a term describing the loss of epithelium-specific function. Indicative for this process are an elongated cell shape parallel to stress fibre formation. Many signalling pathways of TGF-beta1 have been discovered, but mechanical aspects have not yet been investigated. In this study, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to analyse surface topography and mechanical properties of EMT in proximal kidney tubule epithelium (NRK52E). Elongated cells, an increase of stress fibre formation and a loss of microvillus compatible structures were observed as characteristic signs of EMT. Furthermore, AFM could identify an increase in stiffness by 71\% after six days of stimulation with TGF-beta1. As a novel topographical phenomenon, nodular protrusions emerged at the cell-cell junctions. They occurred preferentially at sites where stress fibres cross the border. Since these nodular protrusions were sensitive to inhibitors of force generation, they can indicate intracellular tension. The results demonstrate a manifest impact of elevated tension on the cellular topography.},

@article{Coombs2004,
abstract = {In many situations, cell-cell adhesion is mediated by multiple ligand-receptor pairs. For example, the interaction between T cells and antigen-presenting cells of the immune system is mediated not only by T cell receptors and their ligands (peptide-major histocompatibility complex) but also by binding of intracellular adhesion molecules. Interestingly, these binding pairs have different resting lengths. Fluorescent labeling reveals segregation of the longer adhesion molecules from the shorter T cell receptors in this case. Here, we explore the thermal equilibrium of a general cell-cell interaction mediated by two ligand-receptor pairs to examine competition between the elasticity of the cell wall, nonspecific intercellular repulsion, and bond formation, leading to segregation of bonds of different lengths at equilibrium. We make detailed predictions concerning the relationship between physical properties of the membrane and ligand-receptor pairs and equilibrium pattern formation, and suggest experiments to refine our understanding of the system. We demonstrate our model by application to the T cell/antigen-presenting-cell system and outline applications to natural killer cell adhesion.},

abstract = {The mechanical properties of cells are important for many cellular processes. Here, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) were carried out to characterize lymphocyte and Jurkat cells. The average elastic modulus of lymphocyte is 1.24 +/- 0.09 kPa, which is almost twofold higher than that of Jurkat cell (0.51 +/- 0.06 kPa). LSCM images of sub-membrane cytoskeleton showed a significant difference in the organization of their F-actin structures. Lymphocyte cells had more and thicker actin bundles than that of Jurkat cells. Lymphocyte and Jurkat cells after adding the F-actin destabilizing agent Cytochalasin-B (Cyt-B) were also investigated by AFM. A decrease in the elastic modulus of lymphocyte from a value of 1.24 +/- 0.09 kPa down to 0.34 +/- 0.04 kPa for 24 h was observed, and that of Jurkat cell decreased from 0.51 +/- 0.06 kPa to 0.23 +/- 0.04 kPa. We really believe that this technology will be used for cancer detection and opens a door to study the biophysical properties of signaling domains extending from the cell surface to deeper parts of the cell.},

abstract = {During recent years, atomic force microscopy has become a powerful technique for studying the mechanical properties (such as stiffness, viscoelasticity, hardness and adhesion) of various biological materials. The unique combination of high-resolution imaging and operation in physiological environment made it useful in investigations of cell properties. In this work, the microscope was applied to measure the stiffness of human red blood cells (erythrocytes). Erythrocytes were attached to the poly-L-lysine-coated glass surface by fixation using 0.5\% glutaraldehyde for 1 min. Different erythrocyte samples were studied: erythrocytes from patients with hemolytic anemias such as hereditary spherocytosis and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency patients with thalassemia, and patients with anisocytosis of various causes. The determined Young's modulus was compared with that obtained from measurements of erythrocytes from healthy subjects. The results showed that the Young's modulus of pathological erythrocytes was higher than in normal cells. Observed differences indicate possible changes in the organization of cell cytoskeleton associated with various diseases.},

@article{Hillebrand2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aldosterone at high concentrations causes an expansion of apical surface area and volume of cultured endothelial cells. These morphological changes are associated with endothelial cell stiffening. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the aforementioned aldosterone actions are confined to aldosterone concentrations within the pathophysiological range. Moreover, we investigated whether endothelial cells of venous and arterial origin respond similarly to aldosterone and whether the new aldosterone antagonist eplerenone effectively prevents endothelial cell growth and stiffening. METHODS: We used an endothelial cell line of venous origin (EAHy 926) and primary cultures of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC). Cells were incubated for 72 h with aldosterone at concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 nmol/l. Eplerenone was added at a concentration of 2 micromol/l. Applying atomic force microscopy, we scanned cell layers under fixed and living conditions, allowing measurement of endothelial cell apical surface, volume and cellular stiffness. RESULTS: Aldosterone had comparable effects on EAHy 926 and HCAEC. In EAHy 926, the apical surface increased dose dependently by up to 72 +/- 5\% and cell volume by up to 36 +/- 5\%. In HCAEC, the maximum increase of apical surface was 78 +/- 6\% and maximum cell volume expansion was 58 +/- 6\%. Furthermore, aldosterone increased endothelial cell stiffness from 1.47 +/- 0.08 kPa up to 3.95 +/- 0.15 kPa in EAHy 926, and from 1.64 +/- 0.13 kPa up to 4.31 +/- 0.13 kPa in HCAEC. Physiological aldosterone concentrations had no effect, but starting at 1 nmol/l, corresponding to the low pathophysiological range, substantial cell alterations emerged. Eplerenone, at a therapeutic concentration, prevented the observed actions of aldosterone. CONCLUSIONS: Aldosterone-induced endothelial cell growth and stiffening in vitro begins with concentrations in the low pathophysiological range. The preventive action of eplerenone indicates that the endothelium could be a major target of this drug in vivo.},

Under tension fused bilayers of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) yield to give non-distance dependent and discrete force plateaux of 45.4, 81.6 and 113+/-3.5 pN. This behaviour may persist over distances as great as 400 nm and suggests the stable formation of a cylindrical tube which bridges the bilayers on the two surfaces. The stability of this connective structure may have implications for the formation of pili and hence for the initial stage of bacterial conjugation. Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayers also exhibit force plateaux but with a much less pronounced quantization. Bilayers composed of egg PC, sterylamine and cholesterol stressed in a similar way show complex behaviour which can in part be explained using the models demonstrated in the pure lipids.},

abstract = {Vascular endothelium plays a key role in blood pressure regulation. Recently, it has been shown that a 5\% increase of plasma sodium concentration (sodium excess) stiffens endothelial cells by about 25\%, leading to cellular dysfunction. Surface measurements demonstrated that the endothelial glycocalyx (eGC), an anionic biopolymer, deteriorates when sodium is elevated. In view of these results, a two-barrier model for sodium exiting the circulation across the endothelium is suggested. The first sodium barrier is the eGC which selectively buffers sodium ions with its negatively charged proteoglycans. The second sodium barrier is the endothelial plasma membrane which contains sodium channels. Sodium excess, in the presence of aldosterone, leads to eGC break-down and, in parallel, to an up-regulation of plasma membrane sodium channels. The following hypothesis is postulated: Sodium excess increases vascular sodium permeability. Under such conditions (e.g. high-sodium diet), day-by-day ingested sodium, instead of being readily buffered by the eGC and then rapidly excreted by the kidneys, is distributed in the whole body before being finally excreted. Gradually, the sodium overload damages the organism.},

abstract = {The glycocalyx is the inner most layer of the endothelium that is in direct contact with the circulating blood. Shear stress affects its synthesis and reorganization. This study focuses on changes in the spatial distribution of the glycocalyx caused by shear stimulation and its recovery following the removal of the shear stress. Sialic acid components of the glycocalyx on human umbilical vain endothelial cells are observed using confocal microscopy. The percentage area of the cell membrane covered by the glycocalyx, as well as the average fluorescence intensity ratio between the apical and edge areas of the cell is used to assess the spatial distribution of the glycocalyx on the cell membrane. Our results show that following 24 h shear stimulation, the glycocalyx relocates near the edge of endothelial cells (i.e., cell-cell junction regions). Following the removal of the shear stress, the glycocalyx redistributes and gradually appears in the apical region of the cell membrane. This redistribution is faster in the early hours (<4 h) after shear stimulation than that in the later stage (e.g., between 8 and 24 h). We further investigate the recovery of the glycocalyx after its enzyme degradation under either static or shear flow conditions. Our results show that following 24 h recovery under shear flow, the glycocalyx reappears predominantly near the edge of endothelial cells. Static and shear flow conditions result in notable changes in the spatial recovery of the glycocalyx, but the difference is not statistically significant. We hypothesize that newly synthesized glycocalyx is not structurally well developed. Its weak interaction with flow results in less than significant redistribution, contrary to what has been observed for a well-developed glycocalyx layer.},

abstract = {Here we overview and further develop a quantitative method to measure mechanics of biological cells in indentation experiments, which is based on the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM). We demonstrate how the elastic modulus of the cell body should be measured when the cellular brush is taken into account. The brush is an essential inelastic part of the cell, which surrounds all eukaryotic (the brush is mostly microvilli and glycocalyx) and gram-negative prokaryotic cells (the brush is polysaccharides). The other main feature of the described method is the use of a relatively dull AFM probe to stay in the linear stress-strain regime. In particular, we show that the elastic modulus (aka the Young's modulus) of cells is independent of the indentation depth up to 10-20\% deformation for the eukaryotic cells studied here. Besides the elastic modulus, the method presented allows obtaining the parameters of cellular brush, such as the effective length and grafting density of the brush. Although the method is demonstrated on eukaryotic cells, it is directly applicable for all types of cells, and even non-biological soft materials surrounded by either a brush or any field of long-range forces.},

abstract = {Acute cessation of flow (ischemia) leads to depolarization of the endothelial cell (EC) membrane mediated by K(ATP) channels and followed by production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from NADPH oxidase. We postulated that ROS are a signal for initiating EC proliferation associated with the loss of shear stress. Flow cytometry was used to identify proliferating CD31-positive pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (mPMVECs) from wild-type, Kir6.2-/-, and gp91phox-/- mice. mPMVECs were labeled with PKH26 and cultured in artificial capillaries for 72 h at 5 dyn/cm2 (flow adaptation), followed by 24 h of stop flow or continued flow. ROS production during the first hour of ischemia was markedly diminished compared with wild-type mice in both types of gene-targeted mPMVECs. Cell proliferation was defined as the proliferation index (PI). After 72 h of flow, >98\% of PKH26-labeled wild-type mPMVECs were at a single peak (PI 1.0) and the proportion of cells in the S+G2/M phases were at 5.8\% on the basis of cell cycle analysis. With ischemia (24 h), PI increased to 2.5 and the ratio of cells in S+G2/M phases were at 35\%. Catalase, diphenyleneiodonium, and cromakalim markedly inhibited ROS production and cell proliferation in flow-adapted wild-type mPMVECs. Significant effects of ischemia were not observed in Kir6.2-/- and gp91phox-/- cells. ANG II activation of NADPH oxidase was unaffected by KATP gene deletion. Thus loss of shear stress in flow-adapted mPMVECs results in cell division associated with ROS generated by NADPH oxidase. This effect requires a functioning cell membrane KATP channel.},

abstract = {The topography and elasticity of living and fixed astrocytes cultured from the rat cerebra were studied quantitatively by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Ridge-like structures reflecting F-actin beneath the cell membrane were prominent in the contact-mode images of living astrocytes. Many of these ridges became unclear after fixation (2\% glutaraldehyde). In addition, the ridge-like structures were invisible in the topography of living cells observed at zero-loading force in the force mapping mode, which is considered to show the real cell surface not pressed down by an AFM tip. The topography of fixed cells observed both in the contact mode and at zero-loading force in the force mapping mode was similar to that of living cells observed at zero-loading force in the force mapping mode, although some deformed areas were detected in the fixed cells. The elasticity map images of living astrocytes showed that the cell membrane above the nucleus was softer (2-3 kPa) than the surroundings, and that the cell membrane above F-actin was stiffer (10-20 kPa) than the surroundings. In the elasticity map images of fixed astrocytes, on the other hand, the elasticity of the cells was found to be relatively uniform (200-700 kPa) irrespective of the inner structures of cells. These results show that images observed by AFM should be carefully examined in consideration of the force introduced to specimens and the elasticity of specimens to find out the real surface topography.},

abstract = {A new paradigm for governance of leukocyte-endothelium (WBC-EC) adhesion during the inflammatory process is presented in which shedding of the endothelial glycocalyx exposes adhesion molecules on the EC surface, which promotes WBC-EC adhesion. It is postulated that the effector of this shedding is the activation of extracellular proteases, one of which may be a member of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family of zinc dependent endopetidases. This model for the role of the glycocalyx as a barrier to WBC-EC adhesion includes the additional participation of normally active extracellular proteolytic enzymes, i.e. sheddases, which may cleave proteoglycans or activate lyases that cleave GAG chains in the glycocalyx. In support of this hypothesis, studies are examined which have established the concurrent activation of MMP proenzymes on the EC surface, shedding of the glycocalyx, and enhanced WBC-EC adhesion.},

Initial applications of Raman were identified in the industrial and chemical sectors, providing a rapid non-invasive method to identify sample components or perform quality control assessments. Applications have since increased and sample sizes decreased, leading to the onset of micro-Raman spectroscopy. Coupling with microscopy enabled label-free sample analysis and the unveiling of total chemical composition. Latter adaptations of Raman have advanced into biomedical diagnostics and research. Alongside technical developments in filter systems and detectors, spectral peak intensities and improved signal-to-noise ratios have facilitated target molecule measurement within a variety of samples. Quantitative sample analysis applications of Raman have contributed to its increasing popularity. Through these exceptional capabilities, potential Raman spectroscopy utility in biomedical research applications has expanded, exemplifying why there is continued interest in this highly sensitive and often under-used technique.},

abstract = {This article presents a study on the influence of the protocol used for immobilization of bacterial cells onto surfaces by mechanically trapping them into a filter. In this sense, the surface and structure of trapped cells are analyzed. Bacteria can be present solely or with extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). To test the behavior of the EPS layer duing the filtering process, different strains of a well-known EPS-producer bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis), which produce an extracellular matrix clearly visible in AFM images, have been used. Results show that this immobilization method can cause severe structural and mechanical deformation to the cell membrane. This altered mechanical state may possibly influence the parameters derived from AFM force curves (which are micro/nano-mechanical tests). Also, our results suggest that the EPS layer might move during the filtering process and could accumulate at the upper part of the cell, thus favoring distorted data of adhesion/pull-off forces as measured by an AFM tip, especially in the case of submicron-sized microbial cells such as bacteria.},

This finding was then extended to tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS). Huge enhancements of 70-80x, corresponding to net enhancements of >10(4), were observed for brilliant cresyl blue test analyte when Ag-coated tips made from or precoated with low refractive index materials were applied. The yield of fabricated tips that significantly enhance the Raman signals was found to be close to 100\%. These findings provide crucial steps towards the use of TERS as a robust technique for rapid chemical imaging with nanometer spatial resolution.

@article{Forstermann2006,
abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO*) is an important protective molecule in the vasculature, and endothelial NO* synthase (eNOS) is responsible for most of the vascular NO* produced. A functional eNOS oxidizes its substrate L-arginine to L-citrulline and NO*. This normal function of eNOS requires dimerization of the enzyme, the presence of the substrate L-arginine, and the essential cofactor (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin (BH4), one of the most potent naturally occurring reducing agents. Cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, or chronic smoking stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species in the vascular wall. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases represent major sources of this reactive oxygen species and have been found upregulated and activated in animal models of hypertension, diabetes, and sedentary lifestyle and in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Superoxide (O2*-) reacts avidly with vascular NO* to form peroxynitrite (ONOO-). The cofactor BH4 is highly sensitive to oxidation by ONOO-. Diminished levels of BH4 promote O2*- production by eNOS (referred to as eNOS uncoupling). This transformation of eNOS from a protective enzyme to a contributor to oxidative stress has been observed in several in vitro models, in animal models of cardiovascular diseases, and in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. In many cases, supplementation with BH4 has been shown to correct eNOS dysfunction in animal models and patients. In addition, folic acid and infusions of vitamin C are able to restore eNOS functionality, most probably by enhancing BH4 levels as well.},

abstract = {The mechanical stiffness of individual cells is important in tissue homeostasis, cell growth, division and motility, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the initiation of cancer. In this work, a normal squamous cell line (EPC2) and metaplastic (CP-A) as well as dysplastic (CP-D) Barrett's Esophagus columnar cell lines are studied as a model of pre-neoplastic progression in the human esophagus. We used the combination of an atomic force microscope (AFM) with a scanning confocal fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope to study the mechanical properties of single adherent cells. Sixty four force indentation curves were taken over the nucleus of each cell in an 8 x 8 grid pattern. Analyzing the force indentation curves, indentation depth-dependent Young's moduli were found for all cell lines. Stiffness tomograms demonstrate distinct differences between the mechanical properties of the studied cell lines. Comparing the stiffness for indentation forces of 1 nN, most probable Young's moduli were calculated to 4.7 kPa for EPC2 (n = 18 cells), 3.1 kPa for CP-A (n = 10) and 2.6 kPa for CP-D (n = 19). We also tested the influence of nuclei and nucleoli staining organic dyes on the mechanical properties of the cells. For stained EPC2 cells (n = 5), significant stiffening was found (9.9 kPa), while CP-A cells (n = 5) showed no clear trend (2.9 kPa) and a slight softening was observed (2.1 kPa) in the case of CP-D cells (n = 16). Some force-indentation curves show non-monotonic discontinuities with segments of negative slope, resembling a sawtooth pattern. We found the incidence of these 'breakthrough events' to be highest in the dysplastic CP-D cells, intermediate in the metaplastic CP-A cells and lowest in the normal EPC2 cells. This observation suggests that the microscopic explanation for the increased compliance of cancerous and pre-cancerous cells may lie in their susceptibility to 'crumble and yield' rather than their ability to 'bend and flex'.},

abstract = {In clinical trials, aldosterone antagonists decrease cardiovascular mortality and ischemia by unknown mechanisms. The steroid hormone aldosterone acts by binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a ligand-activated transcription factor. In humans, aldosterone causes MR-dependent endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction and in animal models, aldosterone increases vascular macrophage infiltration and atherosclerosis. MR antagonists inhibit these effects without changing blood pressure, suggesting a direct role for vascular MR in EC function and atherosclerosis. Whether human vascular ECs express functional MR is not known. Here, we show that human coronary artery and aortic ECs express MR mRNA and protein and that EC MR mediates aldosterone-dependent gene transcription. Human ECs also express the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11betaHSD2), and inhibition of 11betaHSD2 in aortic ECs enhances gene transactivation by cortisol, supporting that EC 11betaHSD2 is functional. Furthermore, aldosterone stimulates transcription of the proatherogenic leukocyte-EC adhesion molecule intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)1 gene and protein expression on human coronary artery ECs, an effect inhibited by the MR antagonist spironolactone and by MR knock down with small interfering RNA. Cell adhesion assays demonstrate that aldosterone promotes leukocyte-EC adhesion, an effect that is inhibited by spironolactone and ICAM1 blocking antibody, supporting that aldosterone induction of EC ICAM1 surface expression via MR mediates leukocyte-EC adhesion. These data show that aldosterone activates endogenous EC MR and proatherogenic gene expression in clinically important human ECs. These studies describe a novel mechanism by which aldosterone may influence ischemic cardiovascular events and support a new explanation for the decrease in ischemic events in patients treated with aldosterone antagonists.},

abstract = {Endothelial cells form a multifunctional cell lining that covers all of the inner surface of blood vessels and regulates several important physiological and pathological reactions. These include inflammation/immune reaction, blood vessel tonus, hemostasis/thrombosis, angiogenesis and so on. Thus, abnormalities of endothelial function may play crucial roles in the development of angitis syndrome, thrombosis/embolism, bleeding disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and neovascularization in some pathological states including tumor growth and diabetic retinopathy. Research on endothelial cells now forms a new frontier termed 'Endotheliology'. Recent advances of the functional and structural aspects of endothelial cells are reviewed here mainly from the viewpoint of endothelial regulation of coagulation and the fibrinolytic system. First we show that the natural endothelial membrane protein thrombomodulin is localized not only on apical endothelial surface but also in caveolae. Since it has been reported that such factors involved in coagulation/fibrinolysis as tissue factor, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), thrombin receptor and urokinase receptor are also localized in the caveolae, this membrane structure may act as a special component to regulate coagulation/fibrinolysis on the endothelial membrane surface. Next we demonstrate the signaling pathway of the thrombin receptor. Thrombin cleaves the N-terminus of the receptor as a substrate, exposing a new N-terminus. This newly exposed N-terminus acts as a ligand and activates platelets, endothelial cells and vascular smooth-muscle cells. We have identified that the signal from the thrombin receptor activates NF-kappaB through the activation of protein C kinase, tyrosine kinase and MAP kinase, and results in proliferation of the cells. We have also shown that the receptor is over-expressed on platelets from diabetes patients.},

abstract = {Several techniques are under development to diagnose oesophageal adenocarcinoma at an earlier stage. We have demonstrated the potential of Raman spectroscopy, an optical diagnostic technique, for the identification and classification of malignant changes. However, there is no clear recognition of the biochemical changes that distinguish between the different stages of disease. Our aim is to understand these changes through Raman mapping studies. Raman spectral mapping was used to analyse 20-microm sections of tissue from 29 snap-frozen oesophageal biopsies. Contiguous haematoxylin and eosin sections were reviewed by a consultant pathologist. Principal component analysis was used to identify the major differences between the spectra across each map. Pseudocolour score maps were generated and the peaks of corresponding loads identified enabling visualisation of the biochemical changes associated with malignancy. Changes were noted in the distribution of DNA, glycogen, lipids and proteins. The mean spectra obtained from selected regions demonstrate increased levels of glycogen in the squamous area compared with increased DNA levels in the abnormal region. Raman spectroscopy is a highly sensitive and specific technique for demonstration of biochemical changes in the carcinogenesis of Barrett's oesophagus. There is potential for in vivo application for real-time endoscopic optical diagnosis.},

abstract = {Mechanical loading induces both nuclear distortion and alterations in gene expression in a variety of cell types. Mechanotransduction is the process by which extracellular mechanical forces can activate a number of well-studied cytoplasmic signaling cascades. Inevitably such signals are transduced to the nucleus and induce transcription factor-mediated changes in gene expression. However, gene expression can be also regulated through alterations in nuclear architecture, providing direct control of genome function. One putative transduction mechanism for this phenomenon involves alterations in nuclear architecture that result from the mechanical perturbation of the cell. This perturbation is associated with direct mechanical strain or osmotic stress, which is transferred to the nucleus. This review describes the current state of knowledge relating the nuclear architecture and the transfer of mechanical forces to the nucleus mediated by the cytoskeleton, the nucleoskeleton, and the LINC (linker of the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton) complex. Moreover, remodeling of the nucleus induces alterations in nuclear stiffness, which may be associated with cell differentiation. These phenomena are discussed in relation to the potential influence of nuclear architecture-mediated mechanoregulation of transcription and cell fate.},

For this purpose a TERS spectral map was measured on the biomembrane model, using a step size far below the diffraction limit. Considering the model composition, spectra were classified as either typical for lipids, proteins or both simultaneously, in a qualitative manner. Subsequently, the spectroscopic information was assigned with respect to the topographic features. Since a spatial differentiation between different compositional domains is difficult to achieve by topographic features only, the combination of morphology and spectral data enables a much more detailed characterization of biomembranes.},

When it comes to the manipulation of larger samples with forces of tens and hundreds of nano-newtons, however, the present chemistry-based modification protocols for functionalizing AFM cantilevers to achieve the formation of covalent/non-covalent linkages between the AFM probe and the sample surface do not produce strong enough bonds. For the purpose of measuring the fracture strength and other mechanical properties of stress fibres (SFs) in living as well as semi-intact fibroblast cells, we fabricated an AFM probe with a hooking function by focused ion beam technology and used the AFM probe hook to capture, pull and eventually sever a chosen SF labelled with green or red fluorescent protein.},

abstract = {Actin-based stress fibers (SFs) have fundamental importance in the maintenance of mechanical stability of living cells. Several in vitro measurements of their elastic properties have therefore been made, but direct mechanical manipulation of individual SFs in vivo for the determination of their mechanical properties has not been attempted. No less important is a search for the possible formation of a global mechanical network involving SFs and other intracellular filamentous components. In this article, we present an application of atomic force microscopy to probe into a live cell and laterally push selected SFs in a fibroblast cells (VNOf 06 fibroblast-like cells derived from rat vomeronasal tissue) transfected with a green fluorescent protein-$\beta$-actin gene. The transfected cells were transferred to a serum-depleted medium before the atomic force microscope manipulation. The lateral displacement of the SFs under a point loading condition recorded on a fluorescence microscope revealed both linear and nonlinear displacements against the contour distance from the point of force loading. The nonlinear displacements of the SFs were attributed to their association with a cortical actomyosin-cell membrane complex that effectively pulled them back as a 2D thin plate. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

@article{Rico2007a,
abstract = {Cell adhesion is required for essential biological functions such as migration, tissue formation and wound healing, and it is mediated by individual molecules that bind specifically to ligands on other cells or on the extracellular matrix. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been successfully used to measure cell adhesion at both single molecule and whole cell levels. However, the measurement of inherent cell adhesion properties requires a constant cell–probe contact area during indentation, a requirement which is not fulfilled in common pyramidal or spherical AFM tips. We developed a procedure using focused ion beam (FIB) technology by which we modified silicon pyramidalAFM cantilever tips to obtain flat-ended cylindrical tips with a constant and known area of contact. The tips were validated on elastic gels and living cells. Cylindrical tips showed a fairly linear force–indentation behaviour on both gels and cells for indentations >200nm. Cylindrical tips coated with ligands were used to quantify inherent dynamic cell adhesion and elastic properties. Force, work of adhesion and elasticity showed a marked dynamic response. In contrast, the deformation applied to the cells before rupture was fairly constant within the probed dynamic range. Taken together, these results suggest that the dynamic adhesion strength is counterbalanced by the dynamic elastic response to keep a constant cell deformation regardless of the applied pulling rate.

abstract = {Histopathology remains the gold standard technique for the diagnosis of intraepithelial neoplasia (dysplasia) in Barrett's oesophagus, but it is highly subjective and relies on blind biopsy targeting. The aim of this study was to evaluate Raman spectroscopy, a rapid, non-invasive, molecular, specific analytical technique, for the objective identification and classification of Barrett's neoplasia in vitro. A secondary objective was to demonstrate the need for a rigorous gold standard in the development of new diagnostic techniques. Forty-four patients with a mean age of 69 years (range 34-89 years) undergoing surveillance for Barrett's oesophagus were included in the study. Three consultant pathologists independently assessed snap-frozen oesophageal biopsy specimens. Raman spectra were measured on 87 histopathologically homogeneous samples. Spectral classification models were developed using multivariate analysis for the prediction of pathology. Histopathology and Raman classification results were compared. Raman spectral prediction with a consensus pathology classification model gave sensitivities between 73\% and 100\% and specificities of 90-100\%. A high level of agreement (kappa = 0.89) was demonstrated between the three-subset biopsy targeting model and consensus pathology opinion. This compares favourably with the agreement measured between an independent pathologist and the consensus pathology opinion for the same spectra (kappa = 0.76). Raman spectroscopy appears to provide a highly sensitive and specific technique for the identification and classification of neoplasia in Barrett's oesophagus.},

abstract = {During a spectroscopic study to identify biochemical changes in cervical tissue with the onset of carcinogenesis, residual paraffin wax contributions were observed on almost all dewaxed formalin-fixed paraffin-processed (FFPP) tissue sections examined. Subsequently, the present study was formulated to evaluate the efficacy of current dewaxing agents using Raman spectroscopy. Three cervical FFPP sections were subjected to each of the protocols. Sections were dewaxed using four common dewaxing protocols, namely, xylene, Histoclear, heat-mediated antigen retrieval (HMAR) using xylene and citrate buffer, and Trilogy (combined deparaffinization and unmasking of antigens). The potential for hexane as a dewaxing agent was also evaluated. Sections were dewaxed in multiple dewaxing cycles using xylene, Histoclear, and hexane. Residual paraffin wax contributions remained at 1062 cm(-1), 1296 cm(-1), and 1441 cm(-1). HMAR using xylene and citrate buffer, and HMAR using Trilogy, showed a similar efficacy, resulting in incomplete removal of wax. Hexane was shown to be the most effective dewaxing agent, resulting in almost complete removal of wax. Immunohistochemistry was carried out on dewaxed slides, and those dewaxed with hexane displayed a stronger positivity (approximately 28\%). Implications for histopathology and immunohistochemistry are considered, as well as problems that residual wax poses for spectroscopic evaluation of dewaxed FFPP sections with a view to disease diagnosis.},
